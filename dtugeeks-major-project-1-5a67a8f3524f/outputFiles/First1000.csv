Cheque was LOCAL HDFC cheque which must be cleared within same day day or next day, but it is not processed yet if processed then why the Bank has no status of same.  There are charges for every delayed or failure for customer why not for the bank.  Kindly check and update me the status of my cheque on priority basis.

Dear HDFC,  Please note that i applied for HDFC Credit Card on 06/10/2015 and got Reference No: 15100519293300S2. I got all verification done at my office.

Hi,  I am a user of your HDFC credit card from years and have generally been very satisfied with your level of services. For  current card 4617873001959284 I made a late payment for the month of August 2015 as I was shifting cities and had no access to internet for days. I contacted your customer team and on September 11 I received a reply from Kritika S. (Ref 15254373247) that these charges would be reversed in the October statement (Rs 500 + 411).  However to my utter surprise these charges were not showing reversed when my statement for the month of October was generated. I again contacted your customer care team and asked that when I was assured that these charges would be showing reversed in the October statement then why are they not showing so?  Twice I got the same reply from Murugan (Ref ID 15283184226 ) and Anthony (15285438285) that these charges would be reversed in the November statement. It seemed that a robot was answering to my emails without even reading my emails properly.  I have two questions for which I seek immediate answers from you  1) When I was assured that these charges will be reversed in the October statement by Kritika S on September 11 then why has the needful not been done? 2) Do you hire your customer care officials out of kindergarten. Who make spelling mistakes in emails (my name was spelt incorrectly in both emails) and cannot even comprehend basic emails? (reiterating that the charges would be reversed in the November statement instead of answering why were they not reversed in the October one as I was promised)  Abhishek Manroa 9873262673|2015-10-18T05:13:24+0000

HDFC replaced my credit card but not merged with my existing account so that i can't monitor my transactions at our NetBank credit card section after logged into my NetBank site. And importantly I can't received statements. I several times given rings i mean called c Care but they never answered me even after long waiting and my mobile battery drained. This is the reality of our customer care. Is it's caring or hurting can't i understood. You can see my repayments history that i never failed but at this month i failed due to lacked awarded i never received emails from HDFC I monitor online and I maintained always.

Hi HDFC Bank  I am experiencing the worst customer service for past 15 days. I made a transaction of 19k's on Amazon on 11th August and it was confirmed 15% cashback. Your reps for 3 times told me that it would be credited to me in Oct statement and when I called them today, they said it would be there in Nov statement. Why is so much ambiguity amongst your people? Why can not they share an exact information with the customer? This is making me think to move to some other back . Its pathetic customer service I must say.  Thanks|2015-10-17T15:20:33+0000

Very very bad customer Service by hdfc  1st.. Me & my brother went for bank account opening in a hdfc branch. & they ask for rs.35000 for account opening. Is it a policy of hdfc & also force to take RD policy.  2nd. Today i went to same branch of hdfc bank to transfer my other city account to my hometown. The person told me you hav to maintain rs.10,000 minimum balance in ur account. Which generally rs.5,000 for my hdfc bank account & for other bank accounts also. I said ok for the same. But the personal told me u also have to RD policy from our branch. I refused for the same. Then the personal is going rude & told me if you dont take RD policy i will not open your account in my branch. Im shocked from this scenario. Im operationg & in relation with hdfc over 6 years. But im going to end all relation with hdfc as of now. But i need answer from ur side if i dont want to take any of ur policy. Then your employee going to rude with customer & denied to open a account or transfer the account.|2015-10-17T10:03:44+0000

I am a resident of Pune & have processed my Term Insurance. I have received the confirmation email on the 24th Sept.  Application number - 1100008842872 Payment was made on the 8th Sept, 2015. Today I received a call from the HDFC agent stating that it is taking time for the Underwriters to take a decision. However he also confirmed that my medical tests are clear. What is the use of paying HDFC more than a month ago & the policy is not yet issued???? What is the logic of naming your organization CLICK2PROTECT??? If its taking so long to issue a simple policy?????? There was a lot of confusion during the medical tests also which was resolved by the agent. This email has been sent with specific attachment to managingdirector also. Dont know if this will work with kind of illiterate tele callers who keep calling.

Keeping in mind the festive season I applied for a HDFC credit card on 1st Sept 2015 but till date I have not received any kind of written confirmation from HDFC team. I mean such a great bank like HDFC is operating and treating their customer in such a unprofessional way. Till date I dont even know that whether all those personal and important details and documents of mine collected by the so called HDFC executive was used for a genuine purpose or not because I was left with an application number only (i.e. CC23058043) which never help me out in any ways. The so called HDFC executive (Mobile No: 8190883553) who used to call me 10 times a day before collecting and processing the document has stooped responding anymore even after providing him a new reference customer for credit card. It is such a disgusting thing that I have to wait for a credit card application to get processed for nearly 2 months. I understand that these things are very sensitive case and several verification has to be done but HDFC is so unprofessional that they cannot send a single mail or sms requesting a customer to wait and hire such people those who does't care to respond.   So I request you to at least let me know whether the guy who collected the documents were used for genuine purpose or not because now I dont want to have an HDFC credit card anymore.  Never expected such kind of service from HDFC and just because of your service my name got spoiled in my friend circle as I referred a friend of mine to apply for the same along with me and she is also still waiting for the same.  Thank you for the unexpected service from HDFC Bank and ruining my plans for this festive season.  Bikramjeet Bhattacharjee  Bikram_89@yahoo.com|2015-10-16T16:53:31+0000
Dear Sir / Madam, I came know from your customer service centre shift-incharge that the technology to ensure HDFC bank credit card will prompt for a PIN on usage at any POS terminal is not yet available and is in process. Is  it so? When other bank can provide such card, why this cannot be done at HDFC? How many more months do your customers have to wait for it?|2015-10-16T16:36:30+0000
I recently purchased a Hdfc forex card for travel . It gives me immense pain to say that the type of service your this department has is totally horrendous. We complained about two false transactions to the bank and requested for card statement .We used every Possible medium to get the statement phone banking , email compliant , visit to branch , talking to representative . Every department worked to its worst with IT dept sending us email attachment of statement with no content . Phone banking to our surprise reporting our complaint had been closed  . Physical branch refusing to help saying we used book my forex to purchase Hdfc forex card. For the bank as a grieving customer who is associated with Hdfc from last 9 years  all I can say is - it s shameful if a bank like yours can't stand up to its broad values .

HDFC Bank, Let's skip the greetings.  I made the ill-informed decision to get an HDFC Credit Card.  The level of unprofessionalism, complacency & lack of accountability that your employees have displayed has been impressive. And that was sarcastic.  1. I had applied for the card on 23rd June, the same day as my salaried account was opened and it took one month (30 days) for me to receive any kind of communication on the matter. That too after I wrote a mail to the concerned department.  2. I was asked for all information all over again over various emails & I eventually ended up sending 27 different e-mails with my information. With emails marked even to the managing director. Did something happen? No.  3. I had to send in more angry emails and then finally a sales representative was asked to contact me.  4. He told me of the process and assured me that everything should go smoothly. Did it? No.  5. You guys without giving me any prior information or instruction decided that the transfer method used to credit the salary into my account wasn't right. Even when I offered giving documents endorsing the transfer.  6. Regardless, the application did not go through that month & again I was assured that the next month it would work smoothly. Did it? No.  7. The next month the entire process was repeated & this time I was confident that no bank, however incompetent could actually care so little about service that it would in fact be reckless.  8. I was (Again, only on my frequent calling) told that this time too the card could not be processed because the last time the bank has tagged the application as declined & therefore I can't apply for the card for another 6 months.  Your bank & employees have no intent of service, no idea of ethic & no consideration for your customers. Need I remind you of your tagline, 'We understand your world.'  I am thoroughly disappointed, frustrated & surprised at the typically corporate behaviour, pathetic accountability & absence of responsibility.  HDFC bank, may I recommend 'We don't give a damn about your world.' as your new tagline.  I am surprised by you incompetence & audacity.|2015-10-16T12:40:47+0000

Cancelled flight ticket refund amount not credited to my bank account I have booked a flight ticket on 06/09/2015 from Allahabad to Delhi for Journey date 08/10/2015 through HDFC smartbuy (Goibibo Partner). The Goibibo cancelled the ticket on 30/09/2015 and the amount was refunded by airline as well as Goibibo. I have confirmation e-mail from Goibibo. But HDFC smart buy is not crediting the amount in my account. The HDFC smartbuy flight ticket booking reference no is - 1441779928264598 Many times I call & e-mailed to smartbuy, they have not even replied till now neither their call get connected to customer care if we keep on lone for 40+ minutes also. I would say, HDFC is a reliable organisation. But Smartbuy team spoiling HDFC's credibility. So requesting smart-buy team not to play with customer sentiment. Give correct information & refund the amount in time. If the the amount is not refunded in a day or 2, then I'll be forced to go to Consumer court.|2015-10-16T10:49:19+0000

One more reason to find HDFC bank having pathetic service. I have submitted form in bank for address change on 09th Oct. Its been a week and when I called today to call centre, got update that they have no idea about my form and they have not received it. This is height of stupidity from HDFC bank that first they make to fill the form to get drop at nearest ATM or Bank. And even after a week they are unable to track that request form.  I guess HDFFC is the only bank in 2015 which uses 20 years old updated method of address change by filling physical form with NO guarantee that whether your form will reach correct Bank deppt for processing or not.

I have savings account in Hyderabad kukatpally branch, i Maintained 5,000/- in this account, HDFC started charging for non maintenance of min balance. Now when i did enquiry to the nearest branch they said may be it now 10,000/- for you thats why they have charged so, But still i get sms says when the available balance is less than 5,000/-, your minimum balance is 5000/-. why this kind of fine imposed with out any proper rule to do so.

I  am the HDFC flagship credit card holder with good track record. Logged a complaint ('HBL=031-123-173' ) regarding ClickNgo deal and HDFC bank.HDFC bank aggregator  misleading customers saying that they are Visa partners and they give 20% payback discount card. In fact, ClickNgo is not a Visa partner and customer will able to know when the money is debited using HDFC IVR system.  After long follow up ClickNgo says(Mr.Sanjiv)assured that they have refunded money back to HDFC but HDFC says No.  HDFC RM Mr.Rajeneesh is not giving any support to track the case and every time he says system is down and he never calls back and updates the status. Lousy and delayed reply from PriorityRedressal.CreditCards@hdfcbank.com. I would ask HDFC management why you are not Updating clickNgo claim that is money refunded, why HDFC is keeping relationship with misleading partners and how can they missell the product using HDFC IVR system.|2015-10-16T02:21:12+0000

HDFC is really very bad bank. Their customer care service is the worst . My Debit cards are details were used in transaction by someone else and after one month of lodging the complaint of forging the card details they are just not doing anything. I have provided every documents they asked for and it is now more than one month, they are not able to complete their investigation. I dropped several emails to bank managers but there is no answer  from their side. In their complaint site, I am only able to track the status which was last updated  after two days of the complaint.Since then there is no update from bank side and they is no particular concerned team/people with whom I can follow up. I will suggest other not to continue with HDFC and very soon I am going to change my bank once I reach India. I don't understand what is risk-control team of HDFC is doing for last one month. I do not feel it is secure bank anymore.|2015-10-15T10:57:36+0000

Mr. Puri. My name is Rahul sarkar holding the net banking id: 47329030. I am a loyal customer for  HDFC since 4 years approx. I never face any inconvenience regarding any transaction and i have a good monthly transaction, I was offered a pre approved loan of 7.5 lakhs displaying on my net banking. so I planned a car and took the loan for reference no. 35057125. but then I planned to change the are and gave another request for the same Ref:35701889, but this time it took a long tie for any information against the same. After number of calls to customer care a rude executive denied to help and gave a number of Mr. Prasanna Majumdar( sales manager) who never picks the call: 9312930497. After a long discussion with the loan department I came to know that the verification was conducted and the field guy mention wrong update that once the address was not found and second time the guard was not able to give proper info about the office. I do-not have any guard at my office neither the Field executive contacted me, and wrong information was updated to the dept. I am very much upset with this behaviour from HDFC and I thing It was a bad decision choosing hdfc as when i needed support not is whiling to help me .  I would be Sharing this bad experience of mine to all my colleagues and will ask my dept never to deal with HDFC bank. Sharing this to social networks to masses should know about the worst services of HDFC where always promises are made but never fulfilled. RAHUL SARKAR 9716648269|2015-10-15T10:48:45+0000

Just today I learnt that once HDFC bank customer place cheque book request on 18002703366 it cannot be cancelled. The problem here is the toll free number doesn't ask for any confirmation from customer before taking cheque book request. So person like me who calls to see the IVR menu, get disappointed because it straight away takes the call as a request for cheque book and the customer is charged Rs. 100 for the same. If customer wants to cancel this cheque book request, why HDFC bank not giving any option and making money out of customer errors ?|2015-10-14T10:42:26+0000

HDFC Bank is a big time fraud. Last year i opened a salary savings account with HDFC Bank and there Fraud executive opened a Demat account along with the salary account. I don't even know what should i do with that hell Demat account. HDFC Bank executive opened it without my consent.Just to meet his sales targets. It seems HDFC Bank is encouraging them to do that just to make their numbers.They kept on xharging me noney in my savings account that is the only reason i left HDFC Bank and opened my new salary account with another bank. I called their customer care as well.But the lady bluntly said that i have to pay INR 1500 only then they cqn close my account or else the account will remain active.I would never ever suggest any of my friend to go with hdfc bank at all. These guys are fraud and open the demat account with salary account. Beware and please read the document carefully before signing.|2015-10-14T09:48:42+0000

One of the worst service providing bank to customer. I am an HDFC credit card holder from 2 years. Recently I was looking to change mailing address for my card and was surprised to see that there is no option online or via telephone in HDFC Bank for address change. Only way is to first search for nearest HDFC Bank and then to go there, fill a form and then wait for a week to get address change.  Around an year back, I have called HDFC bank and provided feedback/suggestion to introduce online option to change address but that made no response from bank.  Once I heard that this is in place due to security reason. Its quiet irony that HDFC bank gives option to transfer money upto 50000 via online but not provided option to change address just for security reasons. How does that makes sense if bank says security for this lack of service?  HDFC bank is still using 20 years old outdated way to visit bank, fill form in order to change address which is a big inconvenience for people like me.|2015-10-14T07:08:45+0000

HDFC claims The Largest Bank of the world & Best Bank of Asia.. Worst Bank of World Customer care is just pathetic & Bank Employees are good for nothing. I wanna meet the Credit Card Department head & trainer what the hell dey teach & train to their employees . One should explain every rules & Regulation to every single person, So called Credit card executive has explain to my cousin that irrespective of transaction you should pay after 45 days. but they didn't said about paying in next month when you transact before 19th of every month. When my cousin saw the bill it was due date before 10th. Late fee added & service tax too. When we approach to Bank they said its given in rules & regulation of card documents. My cousin is hardly educate he only can sign nothing more. its a responsibility of credit card executive to explain in detail they r just running for an account to achieve their Target. Beware guys whoever going for HDFC Credit card ask every thing details. I'm gonna apply for new credit card will see what CC Executive explain me. If that guys give me same explanation dat you can pay after 45 days irrespective of whatever days you transact will slap right  der. WORST BANK!|2015-10-14T06:18:28+0000

Today I have lost a substantial amount in fradulent transaction from my HDFC Bank debit card.The fraurstar used my card to shop for CRANBERRY TWP at WALMART in 3 seperate instances, however, no messages were received at my end.I came to know, when I received a single big message having details of all 3 transactions clubbed up together. Calling the CUSTOMER CARE of this bank...aarrrggg...was a pathetic scene....I got to know, that they are raising a complaint ticket. And guess what, they sounded so light that this is a very simple matter for them. No one guided with the money recovery steps.  After doing a bit of google, came to know that these instances of SECURITY BREACH is VERY COMMON for HDFC Bank card holders. Many Instances have already happened, and the BANK is least bothered about its SECURITY.  GUYS.... Its time that we should be careful about this BANK. Our Hard earned money is not safe with HDFC.

My name is Govindarajan.(Cell # 7200720502)  I went to remit Rs 30000/ cash at Tiruppur T S Puram branch on 12-10-2015 to my grand daughter who is in need of money for urgent hospital purpose. My grand daughter V Laskshminarayani having a/c at poonamallee Chennai branch.   However your bank refused to accept cash  remittance and said can accept a cheque which I explained will take  2 days to get credit but she wanted for hospital purpose  Despite of it  Your bank refused to accept cash.  How it is wise that you can  accept cheque not cash.   Is your branch is correct  Rgds Govindarajan|2015-10-13T08:52:55+0000

HDFC MULTI CURRENCY FOREX CARD IS JUST AMAZING !! THEY SEND THE OTP ON YOUR INDIA MOBILE NUMBER !!!!!! WHAT AN AMAZING IDEA !!!! SO PRACTICALLY THERE IS NO USE OF THE CARD WHILE TRAVELING ABROAD & BOOKING FLIGHTS/HOTELS ONLINE. THE CUSTOMER CARE SAYS ONE HAS TO UPDATE THE CONTACT NUMBER EVERYTIME YOU CHANGE YOUR COUNTRY... ANOTHER INTELLIGENT POINT... ALSO SHE TELLS ME THAT IT TAKES 24 TO 48 HRS FOR THE NUMBER TO GET UPDATED.... WOW....SO NOW I AM IN INDIA WITH MY REGISTERED MOBILE NUMBER IN HAND.. TRIED 3 TRANSACTION BUT I HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY OTP .... ANOTHER INTELLIGENT ANSWER IS THAT THE MERCHANT IS SENDING THE OTP & NOT HDFC.... WOW....

HDFC helpline for Savings Account is a big pain. It does not go beyond personal bank account details. Tried for 25 minutes and wasted 5 calls, but no use.

Hi HDFC Team  I had to face a disgusting situation at HDFC bank for the very first time ever in my relationship with the bank since 6+ years. I hold an account at Gopalapuram Branch, Chennai; when I worked at Chennai. Now I am shifted to Vishakapatnam and been here since 3 years. Today I had to deposit some amount to my account through my wife at MVP Branch, Vizag. She was told by a bank employee that there would be charges applied to receive this deposit and when asked why; he replied that as the account is from a different branch. The proper explanation would have been given to my wife saying that when an account holder deposits the money, there wouldn't be any charges and when the same is done any others; charges would be applicable. This made her wait unnecessarily and the employee named Chintada Chiranjeevi had some rude voice at me, when I tried to talk to him. I hereby want to bring this to your notice so as not to loose the fame you have in corporate people like us.    Looking for a good resolution .  Regards Sudheer Reddy Dalli  sudheer.d.reddy@gmail.com|2015-10-13T06:04:08+0000
With HDFC everything is so Hi-Tech and so advanced that the customer would feel like there is no other bank like this. Customer will see the real HDFC when they have to call the phone banking service (saving bank/Credit Card) and here you go, in a records time not before 5-10 minutes your call would be connected to the Customer Executive. The best part, you are paying for this call. HDFC does have toll free number but not for its customers, for people who wants to become customer. Next the executive will not talk in the language you have chosen in the first step of IVR, you have to ask the executive to talk to you in your language (this is best bank in Asia, which cant remember the preference of the customer) Next part you would be validating your self on the IVR and finally (if you are lucky enough) you can make your way to the executive. Now once again you have to follow the same process of validating your self. share your card number (which you have already done on IVR) share your DOB share your mobile number and everything once again (even though you have validated your self on IVR by entering the pin). Now if you ask to talk to the senior your call would be dropped like in my case.   My call was answered by Swapna and she dropped my call without updating me that she is disconnecting. HDFC now i am going to follow your each and every post and express my thought for a bank like you.   This is the same story each time I call HDFC.

Your bank continue deducted 684 Rs every month(this is 4th time) from my saving account 09131000021182 ( dated 08/10/2015) because of non maintenance of account as per notify by sms.   Last month same deduction happened and i complaint by email to your office. Also i visited branch office and completed all formalities for convert my account as individual account as per given suggestion.  When i called hdfc bank betul branch in land line number for clarification, he replied that due to low balance of Rs 5000, thats why they deducted money from account but my balance that time was 40700 Rs. Now i withdraw all money from hdfc accout due to this continue deductions of money by every month. Now i share my bitter experience in social media regarding unethical business going by your company with me and hope so for better solution on this issue.|2015-10-12T14:09:25+0000

I have a current account in hdfc maligaon br. I wanted to open the account in fancy bazar br. But ur executive Mr. Ajit das without my knowledge opened it in Maligaon. When i came to know abt it then he said dont worry the charges charged would be reimbursed. After 9 months of operation of account he got all my charges reversed and gave me an assurance that he would do it again after every financial year. But this time he said that the BM will do it so he accompanied me to the office. After lot of request and insurance plans and everything he said that he can only reimburse 30% of the amount now and later he would do the rest. But its been more than two months since my application being given but no action has been taken as yet. When i call the ABM (CHINMOY) he says it will be done in this week. Dats his statement every time I call him but did not materialise anything. Then I called the BM and he said he has got many reversals in pipeline and my number would come after 3 months. When I requested further than he said that my account does not add to the profitability of the branch and as such its difficult to give reversal to charges. Moreover, he said that Mr. Das would pay you or else you are free to close the account and  Now, is this the service that you provide to your customers. I am very annoyed by the way BM spoke to me. Plz look into this.|2015-10-12T10:23:43+0000

Hi I had contacted HDFC bank regarding RD which was created without my notification from my salary account. That too there were two RD's which were created without my notice and hence a sum of Rs.5000/- has been deducted from my account. I was asked to contact this number 022-6160- 6161 and when I did, the Customer Service executive asked me to consult the branch which consists of my salary account. When I did visit the branch they say that I should get it done from Customer Service. What the hell is this. I had reported on this problem on October 3rd. Everyday I am asked to wait get back my own money. I really need a clarity else this time for sure I will go to consumer court because this is it. And that too the executives dont even have patience to explain what the problem is. PLEASE SOLVE THIS ISSUE, WE WILL HAVE OUR FINANCIAL COMMITMENTS TOO. Its bizzare what you guys have done.|2015-10-12T09:18:59+0000

Worst bank of India in terms of services. They deduct amount from your account without informing. Irony us that they will call you hundred times to get a credit card or to increase the limit of it, but what needs to be conveyed to the customer they keep mum. Looting the public through charges. I would urge each one of you to get your account transferred to more sensible one. I called their so called personalized call center and the response that I get is we can't do anything.|2015-10-10T11:31:00+0000

Hello,  I got the credit card statement with the outstanding amount of Rs.3257.06 and the due date is 25th Oct. Last month I have cleared Rs.11,747 before the date and in the current statement, there are multiple charges mentioned which is shown below: Late Fee = Rs.500 Service Tax = Rs.115.48 Finance Charges = Rs.40.33 Consolidated Markup Fee = Rs.4.58 Billed Finance Charges = Rs.280.02 Total Amount = Rs.940.41  Its a humble request before allotting the credit card to any customer please take him through the additional charges that bank is offering as an add-on which will be directly added in your credit card statement without even confirming you.  Its almost 3 years and I am the HDFC credit card customer and from last few months I have noticed that without informing or noticing me, there is huge amount of charges has been added in the statement and no one is keen to explain in detail the most important fields that bank always love to add in the statement and send across to the customer.  I am also holding 3 credit cards from different banks but have not seen this kind of service or privilege that bank is providing to their credit card holders.  I am ready to pay the amount only when the other charges is getting removed by the bank or otherwise please block my credit card with immediate effect.  Hope to see a positive reply very soon.

This is one of the worst banks in India. They do not deserve any awards. If anything the kind of goof ups they do they actually need to close down.   The bank decides to consolidate all my accounts and does not wait for me to revert. They decide to use all details from an account that has not been used for over 5 years and ignore an account that has been active for about 3 years now, which is my salary account. So all my most recent details are wiped out. Because of which I am not able to use Internet Banking. The customer ID has changed. To activate Internet banking with my new ID is not possible because they have updated my old mobile number. So I would receive the OTP on my old number which is no longer valid.   They have asked me to update my PAN number. They have sent me a perforated letter. On the outside is my name and address. On the inside is someone else's name and PAN number.   I know other people who have had issues with the bank.|2015-10-10T04:46:39+0000
Worst Service by HDFC Bank. I applied for a Credit Card alongwith my 2 Friends. Both of them got verification call as well as personal verification. But I haven't yet got any information about my application. I made 2-3 calls to the executive who collected documents from me but he is also not giving any update. Disappointing Experience................👎|2015-10-10T04:41:29+0000
My first firm opened a salary account with HDFC for me in the Mumbai Malad branch. The account got transferred - without an official intimation to me - into a savings account and has accrued a huge negative balance.  A fact which I got to know just when I wanted to open a new account with HDFC.  I have been trying to get in touch with the customer care via the form on your web site, visited the Bangalore branch umpteen times - so that I can close this account once and for all.   The Bangalore branch indicates that it cannot do much and I need to visit the Mumbai branch for the closure since the account has accrued negative balance. Obviously I won't go to Mumbai just to close your "awesome" account. As a customer, I would assume that I can at least receive one call from the parent branch.  If all of this was not enough, The email address which your Bangalore-Domlur branch representatives then gave - helpdesksupport@hdfcbank.com is again a non-existent email address. Is it too tall an order to get a correct email address for the customer care from your bank employees. The answer is an unsurprising Yes for the HDFC Bank   Appalled by the amazing customer service you have provided till now, I am forced to take this on your social media platform. If the HDFC Bank has any interest in handling a customer request, Please inbox me and communicate. Otherwise, Stop spamming me with the mails that my account has accrued negative balance.|2015-10-10T03:05:04+0000

Well, you folks redefine customer service!  The ATM sucks back the card because I am supposedly late to pull it out --> the card can't be returned for 'security reasons' --> one apples for a fresh card --> a new card comes four days after but blocked --> I need to activate it by going thorough  maze of IVR options --> the card is dishonoured two days after this --> I again go through the IVR option giving my full name, DOB & mailing address to the customer service guy plus enter the card expiry date and my PIN on IVR to activate but oops!

This is with reference to my credit card number. In the october month statement, HDFC has imposed the finance charges for the previous month's outstanding. While I have been making part payments since the last 1 year and hence I have never given a single call to the bank for the reversal, this time I had made the complete payment and that too prior to the due date. Yet, your bank has imposed over Rs 1500 charges on the card which should be reversed off. Else, This is completely unfair and thats the same thing I tried to tell your customer care person. However, he only spoke like a parrot stating that I made the payment late and was extremely rude. I have myself worked with Citibank for three years and aware of all banking rules and regulations and hence have never called up for reversal. However, this month's charges are unwarranted. YOU HAVE PROVED THAT YOUR BANK IS FRAUD AND ONLY WANTS TO EXTORT MORE AND MORE MONEY. PAID PUBLICITY AND MERE RANKING ON A BIG FORUM WILL NOT MAKE YOU CUSTOMER CENTRIC. IT IS LISTENING TO A GENUINE CUSTOMER THAT MAKES SOME COMPANIES STAND OUT AND NOT JUST EXPANDING BALANCE SHEETS|2015-10-09T17:27:59+0000

#hdfc #moneycontrol #cnbcawaz #aajtak #ndtvprofit  #hdfcbank   दोस्तों,                     आज मैं आपका परिचय देश की नामी गिरामी, प्रतिष्ठित , आधुनिक, अग्रणी,बेहतर सेवा देने का वादा करने वाले एक निजी बैंक और उसकी कारगुजारियों से करवाना चाहता हूँ. मैं अपने अनुभवों के माध्यम से आपको बताना चाहूँगा की किस तरह सूट बूट पहन कर और आलिशान ऑफिस खोलकर भी लूटा जा सकता है और जनता की आँखों में धुल झोंकी जा सकती है. दोस्तों उस प्रसिद्ध बैंक और लूट की दूकान का नाम है HDFC BANK. जी हाँ मैं सही लिख रहा हूँ. यही वो बैंक हा जो मुझे और मेरे जैसे न जाने कितने लोगो को सूट बूट पहन कर अपनी लूट की दूकान में चुना लगा चुकी है....... माजरा कुछ इस प्रकार है दोस्तों...       दिसम्बर 14 में      HDFC BANK    की अलवर शाखा (भगत सिंह चौराहा) ने एक गाड़ी नीलामी पर लगाई. मैं भी उस नीलामी में पहुंचा. गाड़ी देखकर मने उसके कागजों के विषय में जानकारी मांगी. वहां मौजूद सेल्स मैनेजर नील कमल जिंदल और मनीष अरोड़ा ने कहा की गाड़ी के हर कागज पूरे है और हमारे हैड ऑफिस में होते है. आप बोली लगाइए आपको पूरे पेपर के साथ गाड़ी मिलेगी. चूँकि मैं HDFC BANK. के नाम और गुडविल से परिचित था मैंने भी अपनी बोली उनको सौंप दी. ...मित्रों , यही से असली खेल शुरू होता है. एक सप्ताह बाद मुझे बैंक से HDFC BANK. फोन आता है  की आपकी बोली सबसे ऊँची रही है आप पैसे बैंक में जमा करवाकर गाड़ी ले जा सकते है. मैंने शाखा जाकर गाड़ी के पेपर मांगे तो कहा की आप निश्चित रहें, जिस दिन आप गाड़ी खरीदेंगे उस दिन से गाड़ी की जिम्मेदारी आपकी और उससे पहले की सारी जम्मेदारी HDFC BANK. की होगी. ...होता भी यही है....  उक्त दोनों अधिकारियों, बैंक के वकील मंजीत सिंह, ब्रांच मैनेजर, और सबने मुझे विस्वास दिलवाया  की यही तरीका है. मुझसे एक लाख बीस हज़ार रूपये जमा करवा लिए गए. मैंने गाड़ी और कागज मांगे तो दो घंटे बाद मुझे कहा गया की गाडी के पिछले साल का टैक्स बकाया है जो आपको ही भरना पड़ेगा. मैं हैरान .... जिस पीरियड में मैं एक एक एक का मालिक नहीं, मैंने देखी नहीं, चलाई नहीं, उसका टैक्स मैं क्यों भरू ? फिर मैं तो जिम्मेदार आज डेट के बाद से हूँ. यहाँ बैंक ने लूट शुरू कर दी. जबरदस्ती मुझसे १२००० टैक्स भरवा है मैंने टैक्स की रशीद ला कर दी तो कहा की गाड़ी को DTO alwar ने यार्ड में रखा है आप उसको रिलीज करवा कर ऑर्डर बनवा लें. ...आप ही बताएं जो गाड़ी मेरे खरीदने से पहले ही DTO अलवर की कस्टडी में है उसको रिलीज करवाने की जिम्मेदारी किसकी है? क्या ये बैंक की चीटिंग नहीं  है? क्या यह ग्राहक को धोखा देना नहीं  है? मैंने खूब भागदौड़ की, DTO के हाथ पैर जोड़े , दलालों की सहायता ली, खूब पैसे खर्च किये तो उस  गाड़ी के रिलीज ऑर्डर बने. सारा खर्चा मैंने उठाया. ...गाड़ी ले तो आया. ..अब बैंक मुझे पेपर देने में आना कानी करने लग गया. एक महीने बाद मैंने HDFC BANK. के MDआदित्य पुरी से शिकायत की तो मुझे आधे अधूरे पेपर देकर टरका  दिया गया. तब से अब तक चार बार तो MD आदित्य पुरी को शिकायत भेज चुका हूँ . कोई समाधान नहीं हो रहा है. लगता है सबने मिलकर एक गैंग बनाया है. आम जनता को लूटने के धंधा खोला हुआ है. मैं तो बस इतना चाहता था की बैंक मुझे वो सभी पेपर उपलब्ध करवा दे जिससे गाड़ी मेरे नाम ट्रांसफर हो सके,  ट्रांसफर का खर्चा तो मेरा लगेगा. पर वो लोग न पेपर देते हैं, न पिछला टैक्स, न RC देते है, आप ही बताये मैं क्या गलत मांग कर रहा हूँ . मैं चाहता हूँ की दिसम्बर २०१४ से पहले के बकाया बैंक चुकाए, बैंक अपने नाम से गाड़ी मेरे नाम करने के पूरे पेपर दे ... पुलिस में शिकायत दी , दस माह हो  चले, कोई कारवाही नहीं, मुख्य मंत्री राजस्थान भी नहीं सुन रही है, ..... अब तो एक ही रास्ता बचा है..... जल्द ही HDFC BANK. अलवर के सामने धरने पर बैठ जाऊं, या गाड़ी को बीच चौराहे खड़ा कर आग लगा दूं................. दोस्तों मैं तो ठगा गया, पर आप इन शातिरो से बच कर रहना. मैंने तो निर्णय ले लिया की अब जीवन में इस बैंक से व्यवहार नहीं करना मैं तीन गाड़ियाँ इनसे पहले भी ले चुका हूँ पर अब नहीं.......|2015-10-09T05:02:06+0000

Have we done any mistake by taking HDFC credit card? Ask yourself this question seriously. Because I feel this every time I receive nonsense calls from your sales representatives. Its not just the calls which create the problem but the frequency of calls. I receive at least 3 call from your sales person in a week. Asking me the same questions and trying to sell me your policy. Personal loan health insurance telephone utility payments.  My question to you is when a person has said that they are not interested then why can't you remove that person from your 'can be new buyer list' and let them rest in peace??|2015-10-08T11:12:52+0000

This is a warning to hdfc bank and i am going to file a case against them for torturing  me in a credit card case. When you people have already credited  an amount of  92 k from my bank account six months back making a lean on my account. This was the final payment and as you people told me that i will be getting a NOC. My credit card was blocked from 2.5years approx. Even now i am receiving  credit card statements every weak. This is really rediculus . This 92k amount was all with interest and other charges. I request you to plz issue me a letter for no dues. Renu gulati.Hdfc branch jorbagh, New delhi. I personally appeal Aadityaji to remove these extra charges.|2015-10-07T22:53:55+0000

U are the worst bank, I have ever seen. Worst Website, I do not know who have designed this website, firstly to understand the concept behind your bloody website, we need to be Einstein .Then that bullshit website will throw you some random error, that your transaction cannot be processed. Now leave all this, your worst customer care will call you again and again for "sir health le lo, ye le lo , vo le lo" and not a single time ,dey will call you till you don't have headache like pins and needles Now leave all that, there is an option in your website , called redeem your reward point.Now when a person tries to redeem again it will show you some error like it cannot be redeemed.. I mean what the hell man , have you designed a netbanking website or just a crap.  Now when the person call your executive, and when you choose option for english, then there comes a guy who speak such terrible english and den that guy thinks that i should have rather choosen Hindi as an option. I mean i think that you people should do good in atleast one thing. there is no reminder from your side ,on phone like sir your amount is due  and ol. i was told that i wud be reimbursed my late penalty and from one and half month you people are just giving me excuse that it will show up in this month billing cycle or next month billing cycle now it has been two billing cycle from that date till now, but nothing  i do not say that i want everything in my favor.But i guess that i can atleast expect a positive and good service. Afterall you are a bank.|2015-10-07T18:04:09+0000
Dt: 07.10.2015  To The HDFC Bank Credit Card Division  Subject: Over limit fee & its service charges.  Hello  I am writing this to request you to kindly waive off the Over limit fee & its service charges that has been charged against my Credit Card No. XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX on 03.10.2015. I was never aware of this over limit term in credit cards.All I know is we can spend within are credit limit and beyond that transaction must get failed or declined due to insufficient credit limit. As I didn't had enough limit, transaction should have got failed, but inspite of that it rather got successfully accepted, and hence this fee was put on.     I had been always very regular with my payments & have never disappointed your Bank in terms of any payments & dues.       I hereby request you to kindly consider this above said matter.

After a long association of six years, I am contemplating to end relationship with HDFC as a customer. The journey was fairly smooth ignoring some minor bumps until the mis-selling. I was using a credit of this company for last five years and they pitched an upgrade for the card. They sold the credit card with charges claiming that there were no charges. When I complained that my statement has charges, they advised to cancel the card and in process all the accumulated points for last five years were gone down the drain. A big THANK YOU for this. If there was a dislike button I would have used it everyday to register the protest.|2015-10-07T14:47:26+0000

I'm using HDFC Bank service from past 8years, they were to be amazing in those days. Now they are ridiculous as leeches..!! They suck..!!  I opened couple of #FixedDeposits last year and the same time without my knowledge & consent #HDFC has added up a #OverDraft loan against one of the FD. And I got to know the same after 6-7 months, immediately i happen to contact Belgaum branch, as usual they did hear anything nor they turn their heads up for my plea. Later i felt that HDFC's in Bangalore, are any day better compared to small city branches.  Finally, a lengthy email to HDFC head office did a trick and the OD was cancelled. With that, the Belagavi branch woke up and started a melodrama. The assistant manager asked apology for all the inconvenience. Followed by whole lot of emotional dialog'bazi and some tissue papers to wipe tears (of him). I was happy that it is ending, rather felt that we are converging at a so called 'Happy Ending'  But for my surprise, after 4months, HDFC shocked me with a CIBIL slap. The irony is, #HDFCBank added this cancellation of OD to my #CIBIL track and now the same is reflecting in my CIBIL record. What do i do with this LEECH, i feel like to squeeze it as hard as possible. #ShameOnYou HDFC..!!!  With this, I alert all my friends to beware from HDFC bank or any other bank, now a days these people smile and say BYE but at the back prick you with CIBIL knifes. The repercussion is - it will hamper 'your repayment credibility' and later the same banks will deny you the loans in emergencies. Stay Safe, Stay Alert..!!!|2015-10-07T12:49:19+0000
How to scare people? Continuously send mails to the customers from HDFC bank: 01. your failed attempt to reset the password 02. your account is successfully registered with password. 03. you have enrolled for 3rd party transfer. 04. you have added a payee named "XXXX".  It is even more scary when you are loged onto HDFC netbanking and you are right infront of the computer and receive such mails  Kudos to the HDFC bank software....!!! Call the customer care, they will advice you to reset the password.|2015-10-07T11:51:29+0000

HDFC Bank is worst bank in the world. It charges without any notification. Never ever take a loan from them they have lot of hidden charges. They cancel your Insurance with out informing you. They disclose your financial details with agencies.They always call from a mobile numbers which are not recorded.They never provide any documents related to deductions for the account, loan,insurance.They use really very bad language while calling.They will screw your family happiness.They will increase the loan charges without your notice. After deducting amount they will refer you to different departments which is running by outsourced agencies who never ever care about a customer...................... ................... .................... ......................... ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,????????? ..........IS IT BANK OR IS IT A BANKING SERVICE????????????????????????????|2015-10-07T07:21:39+0000
I would like to highlight how shitty your service is even for a small Net banking re-activation request. My account got locked yesterday and I called the phone banking service. I spoke to Divya at your end who barely understood my query and kept asking me to log-in to net banking. When I asked her to escalate my request so that I can speak to a supervisor she kept repeating the same steps and mentioning that the supervisor was unavailable and I should retry. Finally after persistent requests to talk to a supervisor, she transferred my call to some other lady who seemed like her peer. This lady kept my call on hold without informing for a record 18 minutes after which she hung up my call. I am just again trying to call phone banking and kept on hold again for 5minutes and waiting.  This is one of the most unethical and pathetic bank service I have ever received. With wasting my 1 hour, I still have no resolution.|2015-10-07T06:34:57+0000

HDFC Smartbuy is the worst service by HDFC bank ever. I have been struggling for getting a refund for a booking for the last 3 weeks, still no luck. And reaching there customer care and talking to them is a nightmare. Not expected from HDFC :(|2015-10-07T05:47:04+0000
Whenever a customer wants to talk to HDFC representative there is no option to talk to customer care without Debit card number. In case someone loose their card but want to know about some fraud transactions or any kind of queries on account one cant contact and raise a complain ticket. And if one want to verify on account system using customer id and telephone id, call gets disconnected just after entering telephone id. And phone system keeps customer on wait list for sometime and disconnect automatically. If representative are already busy talking to some customers, at least call should not be disconnected . Its irritating to call again & again by dialing number pad(everyone's time is precious) to reach to till we get option to talk to customer care. Please do something on this to improve customer experience.|2015-10-07T05:29:12+0000

HDFC Bank; HDFC Bank Connect; I have been cheated by HDFC. I have applied for a home loan, and while applying for loan I was ensured that the processing charges will be waived off since a scheme is coming into effect, I was promised that processing charges will be reverted if scheme is applicable before disbursement.  My loan was disbursed after the scheme was applicable, but the charges was not reverted. I am struggling with their customer care; grievance cell and nodal officer for more than a month now on this.  I have been trapped but I wish no one else fall into their strategy to lure customers. Hdfc Bank is a bunch of liars who will cheat you at drop of a hat just to register their sales, and their customer care team is ineffective, and does not have concern for their customers. entire HDFC BANK works towards one single objective of growing their business; even by unfair means.  Please like and share this post so that many innocent loan seekers are saved form a money launderer like attitude of this bank!|2015-10-07T03:26:05+0000
@Rohan Yeggina Thanks for making the part clear. I lost my temper with #HDFC #HDFCBank process. Mahape,Navi Mumbai branch said "NO" to me to give cheque  book:  1. They ask me to give cheque book. They disapproved my PAN card over it.  2. Person at the desk said me to block my debit card through netbanking or phonebanking while I am standing in the branch and there is no crowd (literally).  3. For cheque book, they asked me to apply through netbanking and says it will take minimum 2 working days to get it in my home branch.  4. Manager (have to mention it) didn't even consider and talks shit.  5. When I filled the form, they disapproved my signature and lied that they informed me my signature mismatch before.  6. I am a customer for 8 years and still have to face it.  Tell me what will you feel when everything happens one by one and you need your money from bank. The reply I got you can see in my previous posts. Anyways planning will soon leave this bank.|2015-10-06T19:13:33+0000
"You people are having worst service level in in the industry and your website is full of bullshit. Why you guys are not having an option of generating password for your food plus card. And your phone banking is disgusting. First of all hell lot of IVR option and then hell lot of waiting and then final surprise that call will be dropped. If you guys have a problem of service level then make your customer care number free of cost. How you guys can expect a customer to hold the call for 30 mins for the query to be answered and finally get disconnected, that is too on chargeable number. Wake up and get you act together guys."|2015-10-06T19:05:30+0000

Hello ,  I have applied for a credit card upgrade . I have applied for Regalia card. I have filled the upgradation form 4 times and everytime the application is rejected.  From last two times HDFC bank is rejecting the application stating that the form was filled incorrectly . Please note - that i filled the form by personally going to the HDFC branch and an HDFC Bank officer sat with me and guided me in filling the form for both occassions.  I have  the picture of my last application and It is filled correctly as instructed by the bank officer.  If my credit card is not upgraded this time - i will close down my bank account and credit card and will move to some other bank. I will also APPLY FOR Closing down HDFC bank salary account option in my company so that no new accounts are being opened from our organization.  I have called multiple times at your call centre and they are unable to help me.

I have just received my HDFC Regalia Credit Card Number 5522 XXXX XXXX 4248.  I was supposed to receive a complimentary priority pass with the card. In the brochure I have noted that I need to apply for the same in the 'enclosed business reply envelope'.   However no such BRE or Priority Pass application was there in the kit.   Tried calling the customer care. The lady just kept the line on hold for a long long time and then just hung up!  Very disappointed with the service indeed. The time to get through to a human being on the telephone line is just too much! And after getting through the person seems to be least interested in sorting out things!  Sent an email to CUSTOMERSERVICES.CARDs@hdfcbank.com  No response!  Can someone help. My number is 9830026187|2015-10-06T07:39:51+0000

Hi Everyone,  I wanted to make this point to all the HDFC users, i started an investment of 25000 rupees/year for a so called policy, in which i was informed that you have to pay 25000 in one go for the first year and then in equal installment for the remaining year which looks feasible to me.   the employee who sold me the policy had left the job and Bank is saying we cannot continue your policy in regular installments and neither can cancel it.   Does this looks like you cannot have faith on your own banker...  I had a big belief on HDFC and they have broken it for just 25000 rupees  I have my Salary account with this bank from the last 2.5 years which i will be closing now.  A very sad end to a relationship.... i expected more from you guys...  This is Shameful|2015-10-05T17:38:44+0000

The dumbest customer care award should go to HDFC, Despite being a so-called "priority customer for them- they simply do not care. It's been over a month since i've been following up for a replacement my lost credit card. Systems are not updated, netbanking transactions don't reflect correctly etc etc. Scary scene - money debited from account but not really credited to the other party (Amazon). Wonky systems and an UNRESPONSIVE customer (s)care team. Closing all my accounts with this stupid bank and moving to our dear ol' nationalised bank. Closing my homeloan, Demat, Salary account - the works. Waited more than a month for SOME response. They really know how to piss off a customer - trust me.|2015-10-05T15:54:55+0000

In the last two months, I must have received over 30 calls from HDFC Bank. Today a certain Mr Ajay Giri from Recovery Section called me and was really abusive. He demanded a payment of Rs 46K to an HDFC Credit Card of mine which I have never received. He was aggressive and kept repeating that I am a defaulter. An email from me to the bank a few days back explaining my case:  Due to a metal strip issue my card was blocked and then re-activated while I was in Europe in June. Upon return, I closed my card **** **** **** 5503 after paying the due amount Rs 44,916.27 on August 5, 2015.   I paid the amount to a new Credit Card  No **** **** **** 4903. I must state that the bank web site did not allow me to pay to the original Credit Card account ending 5503. I have not received this new Credit Card. I have never taken possession of it. I have never used it. I believe now there is an even new Credit Card issued to me. Its number is: **** **** **** 5900. Each of the card shows a replicated payment from one card to another. So, in effect the bank wants to recover Rs 1.3 lakh when the payments of Rs 45K has already been made. That too when I have no Credit Card, two not received and one self blocked.  When I discussed with your customer care they asked me to escalate. The email bounced. Hence this post here. Very disturbed.|2015-10-05T10:03:49+0000
Dear HDFC support Team;   it's very sad to inform you that I really had very bad experience with your support team. As my forex card is block and I'm calling on your chennai number 61606161 from past three days to unblock my card, every time I receive one response that we have forwarded your request to back end team and they will contact me in 2 hours, but it seems there is no effort make to resolve the query. Since after this kind of support I really have no good feed back for you as I'm away from the country and there is no proper services for the customer. Seriously I want to discard this card.  Thanks & Regards Ashish Gupta|2015-10-05T09:54:12+0000

HDFC Bank, please stop claiming yourself the best bank in India. You guys are really pathetic in customer service. Can someone please explain why it would take you twenty days to update an address for regular customers whereas for classic customers you would do it just over the phone. And the fun part - i dropped the application in your branch dropbox and till next seven days your people did not have an idea that it was there!!|2015-10-05T08:17:14+0000
Dear Team,   I have been extremely disappointed at HDFC’s customer service. The Bank makes such big promises towards a hassle free banking experience.   I owned a HDFC Bank’s Forex Card since 2011 and wanted to refund the un-utilised balance (before the card expiry). A request for the same was made to your Rohini Sector-09, Delhi Branch.   The request was turned down (teller’s name withheld) saying no such procedure/ practice is followed unless you have an account with HDFC Bank. I was suggested to speak to Customer Care to confirm the process, if any or drop an email to your Mumbai HO.   This is no-where on earth acceptable that your executives sitting at the authorized teller’s desk do not know about the procedures of their own Bank or Banking, in general. Also, this person suggested me to sell the card to any other merchant outside. Ridiculous, it is!!   As suggested, I was made to speak on the Customer Care. The person on other end confirmed that even if someone does not have an account can get refund in form of either a banker’s cheque or e-transfer in any other account with any other Bank. I made this person speak with the Teller at the Bank, but of no use. The Bank’s Call Center Executive tells me to write a letter addressed to the Branch’s Manager requesting issue of the Cheque or e-transfer.   We followed the advised process over 20 days back and had been promised an e-transfer in few days. The balance has not been credited to me till date. We had been following up with the Branch and were told that the email has been given to HO and what not!  Need your urgent intervention in expediting the process. We really can’t keep following up with the Bank every week to get an infirm response.    Himadri|2015-10-05T08:12:40+0000

I requested a new cheque book via net-banking portal over a moth ago. But till date the packet hasn't arrived nor there any news of it. I did receive a SMS saying the packet is couriered via First Flight Courier 3 weeks back. I already lodged a formal complaint on 22nd of Sept. via tele banking under complaint number KOLC 0915040151 . But till date the packet has not arrived. Meanwhile I got 2 calls from HDFC Banks Chennai office on the same. In both the occasions I was told that the matter is taken very seriously and team is looking into the issue.  My question is how come the packet got missed and why Banks like HDFC are relying on such careless courier companies. Same thing happened last month when my credit card was dispatched from Chennai office and same was not delivered to me for a week by Blue Dart although it reached in their office in Gangtok.   Meanwhile I received one more SMS saying that a new cheque book has been sent via Blue Dart courier and another SMS asking me to collect the cheque book from HDFC branch.  Can I see an action now instead of false assurances.|2015-10-04T12:34:21+0000

We booked a hotel through HDFC's SmartBuy. Hotel/Room information given on SmartBuy was misleading. We decided to cancel this booking the moment we received details from hotel, because booking we not as per the details mentioned on SmartBuy. While cancelling the reservation (on 12th Sep), we were told  that the amount will be refunded within a week. We have not got the refund till date. Followed up with HDFC SmartBuy customer care team several times. Spoke to Jerlim, Prashant (supervisor), Shalini and one more person (don't remember his name) in last one week. All of them assured to process refund within a day, but failed to do so. Not only this, every time we called them, they promised to call us back within an hour to share the status, but never called back. Complaint number registered with HDFC Smart Buy is HDFC123456712724.  Quite a poor experience and quite a poor service. Wonder if there is a resolution to this...|2015-10-03T12:28:02+0000
HDFC Bank, I will like to thank you for helping me learn something new today and probably giving me one of the greatest surprises I have had in my life. Today i learnt one's account's details can be modified without one's knowledge and all that the bank does is makes excuses and sleeps on it. Well to give a background, I logged into my account online to realise that my dear salary account now belongs to some other person and i have no access to all my hard earned money. I called up the customer care service and was not able to connect to any executive as i no longer have any accounts linked to my customer id. I went to the nearby branch to realise that the branch folks have no access to check who or why has all this happened without my knowledge. I was again routed to the customer care service which i somehow managed to get through this time using my husband's details. They told me it is some batch process update which was run and my access will be enabled within 2 hours. I am still awaiting the access and the confirmation call that the team promised me hrs back. Please can you enlighten me why such a massive blunder was committed and i hope some stranger is not celebrating partying with my money....Amazing customer service...Kudos!! #HDFCBank  #PatheticService|2015-10-03T11:40:32+0000

Hello, I had registered meaningful request (Complaint number=15220773633; Month=August) to you (HDFC) to check my credit card service about why SMS was not delivered at my registered mobile after withdraw of heavy amount, Since I requested, I have not been received any call or solution from your side (HDFC) except SMS which I had received day before yesterday wherein closure of credit card details mentioned which I never gave at all. Consequence, I called at Customer center & wrote email to credit department as well but No appropriate solution received as of now. Even Call center representative is not quoting any words about solution, It seems they are just pretending to hide the negligence. Now Could you please help to clarify or shed some light what exactly you guys want to do? or should i need to take legislative action on this act. Also interested to know: Did these services you committed with me? “Or” Is that standard of your HDFC bank services wherein anything can happened anytime anonymously? However you like, Please tell me know at least once, so that I can make my mind accordingly and think before next alliance. Thanks in advance for anticipated earlier response. Thanks & Regards, Gaurav kumar 7838312637|2015-10-03T09:53:06+0000
Is it possible to change the payment cycle of the credit card? My payment date is 25th. Because of that I don't use it much. I have other cards too, for which payment date is the first working day of month. That's more convenient because I will get salary by that time. Other than that, I am very happy with your service. Even though, had some issues, all where handled very well. Thanks for that. Your service is really awesome. When I go to the branch also, their approach is very nice. That's why I continue HDFC account even after resigning from my previous company, for which HDFC was the salary account.|2015-10-03T09:00:31+0000
Dear HDFC bank, this is epic. You guys should change your slogan from " we know your world" to " we know how to make your world miserable". Two years back,  I used to have a salary account in your bank. I changed my company, and you guys changed my account from salary to savings. You did that without letting me know. You haven't send any communication to me either on mail or sms. You didn't even give me a call about this change. You wanted me to keep a balance of 10k. Again you forgot to communicate on this. You kept charging me for insufficient balance. You charged 5k till date and you know what again forgot to inform me abt it. You started informing me about it only when I started a new account in your bank and that is three months back. Now I want to close the account and you will not do this unless i settle these charges. Seriously guys, if this is how you make profits, shame on you.|2015-10-03T07:30:51+0000

Lazy & incompetent Sales staff seem to be the norm at HDFC. Such typical indifference and unprofessional work mentality is not expected.  Yesterday at 2:07pm your Mr.Sagar from Bangalore (8067533600) called for verification of my Personal Loan Application No. 2044345665.   At that time I was on the way back home from work, so I told your him to call me back in half an hour. The call lasted for 25 seconds and I told him I would be free to talk to him and will verify all the details he wanted.  Two days have passed but there has been no call-back in this regard. Outsourcing to cheap companies tarnishes HDFC's image.  Please ask Mr.Sagar (or someone else) to call me tomorrow anytime AFTER 2:30 PM... I will be available.  I REPEAT ---- DO NOT CALL BEFORE this time as no calls are allowed inside the school premises.  I expect BETTER CUSTOMER SERVICE than this.|2015-10-02T07:22:53+0000

Question 1 : Are Banks allowed to break the principal amount of as many of your FDs to recover taxes in the presence of sufficient balance in the account even in the so-called breach of interest threshold limit ?  Question 2 : Does one have to sign the Customer Consent on TDS Recovery from CASA Form to protect the principal amount of your FDs from being broken by the Bank ?   Would greatly appreciate everyone's feedback and advice on this because I am facing this problem with HDFC.|2015-10-01T09:02:57+0000

Hello Team,  This is Sumeet and I m using HDFC credit card since last 3 years...  In my card I have a option to pay bill by EMI which is not working properly, I mean whenever I do transaction lower than   5000/10000 the offers remains there, But when I do transaction over 25000-30000 the offer changes and show me error   "Customer is not eligible for this offer"  So why HDFC Credit card is doing such FRAUD???  This is not the first time , this had happened in around June/ July (check your records) Call center Agent said just do your transactions and then call us so we can convert all outstanding to EMI...and when I   called Agent said , " Sir, there is no such offer on your card.....  Now again last week I tried and i was eligible for SMART emi , due to an emergency I needed to pay 30000 to hospital,   then I thought i can convert it in SMART EMI so not too worried , but when I logged in to net banking and checked suddenly   my offer changed and showing "Customer is not eligible for this offer"  THIS IS JUST A FRAUD.  I'm ready to pay all outstanding(By EMI only) if this is not going to convert in EMI....  Sorry then this is not going to happen I'll not pay a single paisa. do whatever you can do.|2015-10-01T05:19:43+0000
When do you guys plan to go digital? Change of address for credit card (CC) needs a written letter, closing the CC account needs a written letter, reissue of returned CC needs a written letter. But if you ask for credit limit enhancement, they will do it over phone.  Cos f**k Logic?  But when you issue CC, your guys come in person and take the required documents & follow up.  You are loosing customers for this stupidity. Act now. Customer service guys doesn't take any action regarding this.   Compare your services with other banks. Learn!|2015-09-30T19:17:40+0000

Hi Team,  I was maintaining a salary account with HDFC bank for the last 1 year. I resigned from my job in the month of July. Since then there was no salary credited in the account. Got a mail that from oct 1st, the salary account will be changed to regular savings account where I need to maintain minimum balance. I would like to close the account tomorrow as I will be joining in a public sector bank where our own bank will open a salary account. So is there any charges applicable for closing the account ? According to my understanding need to submit account closure form in the nearest branch.Please clarify.  Thanks.|2015-09-30T15:23:04+0000
I took education loan from you (HDFC credila). When I took the loan in March 2013, the repo rate was 7.5 and it increased to 8.0 in Jan, 2014 and you increased my education interest rate from 13.5% to 14.1%. Now when the repo rate has come down to 6.75%, you are still not reducing the education loan interest rate.  When I inquire via mails, I get the same unacceptable reply that there are cost of funds and cost of operations and risk premium and all. Do you mean to say your management of funds is so poor that you can not reduce the rates even when the repo rate has gone down by 1.25%? When the rates were increased, you increased the interest rates in no time but now you are not even replying properly.|2015-09-30T10:33:11+0000
पिछले लगभग 7-8 वर्षों से मैं HDFC बैंक का ग्राहक हूँ. इस बैंक से मेरे पास एक बचत बैंक ख़ाता, एक बीमा बचत पॉलिसी, डेबिट कार्ड व एक क्रेडिट कार्ड हैं. मगर बड़े खेद के साथ कहना पड़ रहा है कि इस बैंक का ग्राहक बनने के कुछ समय बाद मुझे ऐसा लगने लगा कि शायद इस बैंक से जुड़कर मैने कोई अपराध कर दिया हो. इस बैंक के अतिरिक्त 2-3 और बैंकों में मेरे और मेरे परिवारजनो के खाते हैं, परंतु इस बैंक से घटिया सर्विस आज तक मैने किसी और बैंक की नही देखी हैं. दूसरे बैंकों के कर्मचारी हमें केवल "बैंक कर्मचारी" बन कर मित्र की तरह मिलते हैं, लेकिन HDFC बैंक के कर्मचारी हमारे साथ "मालिकों" की तरह ऐसे पेश आते हैं जैसे हम उनके मातहत अद्ने नौकर हों.  ऐसा लिखने के लिए माफी चाहता हूँ, पर सच ये ही है. कम से कम मेरे साथ तो ऐसा ही हो रहा है.  यदि यह बात बैंक के बड़े अधिकारियों या मालिकों तक पहुँचे तो मुझसे पूछिएगा ज़रूर कि मैनें ऐसा क्यों लिखा, मैं सबूत सहित फिर हाजिर होऊँगा.  तब तक के लिए धन्यवाद.....|2015-09-30T10:27:36+0000

Hello Team  My father has been duped by the a policy he brought from none other than the branch manager of Ahmadabad. The Manager shared half  the details of the policy and assured my father that the principal amount will never come down, even though my father kept asking him to proper documentation of where his balance stands in that policy. Still he assured that everything is going well and asked my father to proceed further by depositing the remaining installments and leave the policy for 5 years. At the end, he tricked my father of almost 40% of the deposit. My father has mailed the details to the respective branch manager and he has not received any response for the last 10 days. The complaint reference number is 0100000303160. Shame on you HDFC Life and shame on your bank HDFC Bank if you do not reply to my father`s query asap.

There are a lot of problems with HDFC All Miles website. I tried booking a ticket with my reward points and the credit card. I tried 4 times and it failed! I ended up paying Rs. 1,20,000 to you, without having a ticket in my hand! The last try was after your customer care confirmed that now I can go ahead and book. It has been two days and still your technical team has not been able to resolve this issue (as confirmed by your customer care). It is really upsetting & frustrating to wait for the website to be ready before I can book the ticket for my holiday. And I don't even know if the tickets will still be available after you resolve the issue. It feels like I am the first customer trying to book an international flight ticket through your website and the whole thing looks experimental at it's best.|2015-09-29T07:21:17+0000

DEPOSITORY CHARGES NOV14 - 38818160I am holding HDFC BANK ACCOUNT from last two year. I got it open as a salary account and now its a saving account or moreover seems to be a DEMAT account(suppose to be Free service as informed by HDFC). Now i see an amount of 775.31 had been deducted by HDFC without informing to account holder. I want to know why amount got deducted from my account as you people said it will be a free service and i have not even used it a single time.At the time of opening account, you say its free of cost and later you start deducting the money even though user is not using the facility that too without any prior info. I have not even logged in to DEMAT account since i opened and was not even willing to take it, but they forced and told that it is free and no deposit will be required and charges will be deducted. I want my money back with a valid explanation for why the amount is deducted from the account directly without informing the account holders.Look into the issue at the earliest and revert my money back to me as it is hard earned money. I want this amount immediately reversed otherwise i would like to take it up to compensate me with mental agony as I now fear what will happen if i have a huge credit balance in my account and one fine day HDFC will just wipe off the same. Do revert me back on umesh9690@gmail.com. and i had raised a complain with reference number MUMT0915-346936|2015-09-28T17:48:06+0000

The rented premises is in a building on eviction notice by DDA.  2. Gutters are just outside the banks backside and overflowing quite a number of times. ( We understand that RBI laid norms for gutters near bank premises. ) 3. Almost 4 ft. water could be seen in the locker room in the basement being constructed during last rains. Thanks goodness, the bank was not operational. 4. Their is Patri Bazaar running on left side, right side and in front of bank. Even a Chaatwaala with gas stove in front of bank! Security being compromised to such an extent! The whole pavement on the outside of one wall is being run as shoe shoppe by the owners of the bank premises. Gives an impression that HDFC has started selling shoes on pavement. 5. 2 Taps have been put on the backwall of your bank premises with overflowing water from overhead tanks used by the shoe dweller for drinking purpose. Chi Chi! In a time when Delhi is fighting Dengue. Hope MCD officials take a quick look.  Hope the higher bank officials will be responsible enough to look into the matter and act before such things go onto a public domain and tarnish the image of your reputed bank and confidence in banking with you.|2015-09-28T12:34:18+0000
Hello,   I have applied for a personal loan from HDFC Bank on 15th of Sept, got the reference number on 17th. After that my application is under review. My telephonic verification has been done several times. You people say that you give loan on same day. Its now 11 days and I have got nothing. Every time I call the loan person he says that my physical verification is not done. No one has called me or came to my office for verification. I mean how insensible is this, that a person needs some amount for some urgent work and I am suffering just because your people do not want to work. Is there any way I can check if this loan is going to be disbursed or not?|2015-09-28T12:19:13+0000

#securitylapse, #telebankingfraud Today my friend got a call from some one calming that the bank is blocking my account/#atm card due to kyc issues, we at the onset figured the #fakecaller and played along, the caller asked for debit card no., expiry and ccv , which were provied from 2 dead/bared  #debit #cards (1 #hdfc and 1 amex cc ), now the question is how was the scammer able to send us an otp from the #hdfc server , they tried using the card on #mobikwik #citruspay we also a have recording of the entire call, the callers no. +91 95 70 414305. I would urge the bank to take stern action on the scam and enhance its, the details he need were not very difficult get otherwise. We use our card in various places like #restaurants/malls  and this detail can be extracted very easily. Assuming a scenario where somebody calls, already having there details and asks just for the #otp , ppl would easily trust him and share the #otp since he already has the card details . #savetheinnocent #dosomething & #keepsafe|2015-09-28T09:55:21+0000

Dear Sir/Madam, I am extremely disappointed with your service. First of all, your bank executives either don't have any knowledge on banking protocol or they lie to their customer. Secondly, even after filing a complain there is no update and customer care executives have no idea on what is the complain about, what's the status. We always have to follow up and raise another complain to get resolved. This is really a pathetic service. Pls. find below my complain numbers: banc0915098350  banc0915153452  Just to inform you that I am classic customer and I have my salary account in this bank, still the service which is given to me is quite disappointing...|2015-09-28T06:55:05+0000

Hi, This is about the HDFC credit card which I recently applied via net banking after getting tons of advertising sms, calls and emails about life time free card. The offer looked good to me and I went ahead for credit card application and it was clearly mentioned that it is "PRE-APPROVED". I provided all the address proofs they ask me and it is has been close to a month since I applied for it & I don't know what you are upto. I called phone banking folks and visited the branch but all in vain. If you guys don't have real intention of delivering offers which you promised, I request you to stop wasting people's time and don't do such mass communication.

Few features you should update in your age old internet banking - Do SI. Currently you can't set any standing instruction using internet banking. Seriously ?  - Update Address and Phone no online for credit cards. The feature is available for debit cards but not credit cards.

I just had the worst banking experience of my life. I am sharing two disparate issues I current encountered with HDFC and both led to equally bad customer experience.   Issue #1 - I purchased an all currency Travel card from Powai, Mumbai branch and was told that I don't need to visit an HDFC branch to top up the card as I could do that through net banking. Required IPIN details were to be provided in the kit. To my dismay, the kit did not have any such details and as a result I was stranded in a foreign land with limited funds. I tried to call customer care but in vain. To add to my worries, the card did not work at most of the merchants and ATM machines, in spite of being tagged as a VISA card.  Issue #2 - I visited HDFC Vikhroli branch couple of weeks ago and I was told of a pre-approved Credit Card. The branch manager applied for the card on my behalf and told me the card will be dispatched in a week's time. It's been over 2 weeks and I did not receive any communication regarding this. When I called customer care, I was told that the request was rejected. The customer care rep. refused to provide any reason for the rejection and kept transferring my call from department to department. After an ordeal of 30 minutes, I was taken back to the main menu to start the whole process again.  I have banked with ICICI, Kotak, Citi and HSBC in past, but never had such a bad experience. With this message, I want to let you know that I am deciding to shift my account from HDFC bank and would encourage those in my network to avoid wasting their time and money on such an unresponsive and unprofessional organization.|2015-09-26T07:06:59+0000

I am yet to receive the Taj Epicure card, despite your promises.  I fail to understand the logic of the procedure itself. If you are offering a free membership, why should I apply for and  and 'claim' it ? And after once 'claiming' it I had to apply again, write on your facebook page and call phone banking several times. And to date I have not got the card.  Also, a points redemption which claim was initiated weeks ago for a cleartrip  travel voucher has not been received either.  A week ago, I called phone banking to enquire and was told both are still under process.  Needless to say, I don't feel like a 'premium' customer when I have to go through so much hassle for such a straightforward procedure.  In fact, I am thoroughly dissatisfied  Zachariah Abraham|2015-09-26T03:45:24+0000

Please help me not... Customer care people disconnected my call.... # 9836524691|2015-09-25T09:20:00+0000
Hi Team HDFC - Payzapp,  Let me explain the whole thing here.  I had booked an air ticket using SmartBuy-Payzapp, the new service launched by HDFC on 21 Aug, 2015 worth Rs. 5821/-. That evening I got a call that my ticket has been cancelled automatically. I have heard similar complaints from people who have used SmartBuy. I then booked the same ticket from another website and it was booked successfully.  I then registered a complaint with Payzapp when I did not get my refund even after 15-20 days. First of all, one has to wait for 15 minutes to get connected to the customer care and then they hang up the call in between. But I still managed to call again and get connected after waiting for long.  I had forwarded the mail to you stating that the merchant had sent the refund to you. Around 2 weeks back, your customer care told that the refund is under process and will be done within 48 hours. A week passed, nothing happened. 1 week back, I again called and your customer care told that the matter has been escalated and the refund is under process. It will surely be done by 5-6 pm that day. Again a week passed, nothing happened. When I called your customer care today, they told that the refund is under process and I should wait for 48 hours. And the call got disconnected as usual.  Additionally, I am a preferred corporate customer of HDFC and this is the service being provided. Even IRCTC sends the refund within 2 days. I request you once again to refund the amount. As far as Payzapp is concerned, I will not even dare to use the service ever again.  Thanks, Ayush|2015-09-25T08:26:03+0000

DEPOSITORY CHARGES NOV14 - 38818160 I am holding HDFC BANK ACCOUNT from last two year. I got it open as a salary account and now its a saving account or moreover seems to be a DEMAT account(suppose to be Free service as informed by HDFC).  Now i see an amount of 775.31 had been deducted by HDFC without informing to account holder.   I want to know why amount got deducted from my account as you people said it will be a free service and i have not even used it a single time. At the time of opening account, you say its free of cost and later you start deducting the money even though user is not using the facility that too without any prior info.  I have not even logged in to DEMAT account since i opened and was not even willing to take it, but they forced and told that it is free and no deposit will be required and charges will be deducted.  I want my money back with a valid explanation for why the amount is deducted from the account directly without informing the account holders. Look into the issue at the earliest and revert my money back to me as it is hard earned money.  I want this amount immediately reversed otherwise i would like to take it up to compensate me with mental agony as I now fear what will happen if i have a huge credit balance in my account and one fine day HDFC will just wipe off the same.  Do revert me back on umesh9690@gmail.com. and i had raised a complain  with reference number MUMT0915-346936|2015-09-25T05:16:14+0000

I have no idea why your customer service doesn't even bother to talk.  I've been dropped from the call more than 15 times in 2 hours time while talking to your agents .  So disappointed.

HDFC Bank Mutual Fund Account -  ISAQMC-ST-EC Jul-Sep15-287234 180915  Hello HDFC Bank, I have been leived the following changes for using the Netbanking Mutual fund account. When is this started to bang us with every quater, this is not a trading account: ISAQMC-ST-EC Jul-Sep15-287234 180915  Tried reaching Customer care and it is of no help they only ended up with sending us from Banking Section to Mutual Fund Section and Mutual Fund Section back to Savings account. There has been a deduction of 171 for Jul-Sept quarter. I do not have and mutual fund.

Faced an issue of levying depository charges of Rs 855, in the month of August, without any prior notification from the HDFC bank. I have a salary account with the HDFC bank. At the time of opening of salary account, I have been told by an HDFC representative that its the free service provided by the bank to all the employees of my company, as per the tie up policy with my company.  Also if one doesn't use the account, no AMC would be levied. Now all of a sudden in the month of august, bank has deducted Rs 855 as depository charges without any prior notice. I never used the account nor I have been intimated that such account is been opened.  These deceitful practices is very unfortunate on the part of an esteemed bank like HDFC. I would request bank representative to respond to this complaint.  Looking for a favourable response.|2015-09-23T15:06:12+0000

After a few days I checked my profile through netbanking to find that my address was not changed although in the same account (number) my wife has  changed address   I contacted our Relationship Manager who said "as per his seniors, although I am a joint holder alongwith my wife I need to apply for change of address separately".

Hi, as asked I had sent a mail to 'talktous@hdfcbank.com' with complete details but nobody responded. Moreover I had asked Ms. Anjali (8711858880) who was in contact with me for the loan, to return my personal documents that I had submitted for the loan. She said that the documents would reach me today morning between 1o-10:30am. When I called her in the morning, she never responded to my calls and when she did respond (much later), she said that I will get the documents by 1PM today but till now I have not received it. when I called her again (few minutes back) she had the courage to tell me that those documents are of no use for me anymore so why do I need it?? I told her that it doesn't matter and I need my documents back. To which she said (very rudely) that she is not interested to keep my documents but she will not give it to me today. I firmly told her that I need it or else i will complain then she said 'no you will not get it' and banged the phone on my face. This is disgusting. It's like stealing my documents. I need my personal documents right away or else I will take strict action. I am very upset. I have never had any such experiences before with any other banks.|2015-09-23T09:19:05+0000

Dear HDFC.. This is to put in your kind notice.. that your customer service is pathetic.. 45 days back I applied for a salary a/c In fact its been applied by my company and one of your executive came and collected all my doc's and reconfirmed that nothing is pending form our side he also assured that a/c will be activated in next 4-5 days... Later on I received the salary in my a/c on 7th September and its showing credited in my a/c.. But I am still unable to do any transaction bcoz my a/c is still not activated. I try to contact your customer care many a time and wanted to know the reason but they told me some doc's is pending and we will arrange a call to resolve your query here is the complain no. DELC0915106164. Next 5 days I waited for a call from your side but nobody bother to call me. I again try to contact you guys and I got the same response that we will arrange a call and I got another complain no. which is DELC0915119314. And as expected nobody called me again. Now all I want to know how much time you required to just to arrange a call and tell me the reason of deactivation of a/c. I am not expecting you will resolve the concern in 3-4 days But at least you should arrange a call and explain and understand the concern. Its a salary a/c you should understand the importance of it. My brand address is- VATIKA ATRIUM, A-BLOCK, Golf Course Road, SEc 53...  Kindly resolve the issue asap... I hope you will take this written intimation seriously....|2015-09-23T06:12:16+0000

Hi,  I applied for a loan earlier and I got an email from HDFC bank that my loan reference number  35051424 has been approved. This happened on Sept 08, 2015 but after that I did not hear anything from anyone. Then i reapplied for a loan and I got a new email that my loan reference  35308003 has been approved and somebody called me from HDFC and took a few information and told me that the loan is approved. How many days you people take to credit the money in the bank account? Today i called up the phone banking and even they have not been able to help me. Even their supervisor Taranjeet told me that he can just forward the information to the loans department and cannot do much about it. I am banking with you for lst 12 years and this is the most pathetic experience that i have had. Your phone bankers are not cpable enough to answer the queries.  Can somebody tell me if i will get the loan or not else i will go to some other bank as HDFC is not capable to do this job for me???  Regards Abhiishek|2015-09-23T04:40:06+0000

Bank is smartly making money in all petrol transactions done through credit/debit cards . The surcharge they charge and the amount they reverse differs . They don't reverse service tax and enjoy free money of customers. When i raised this to customer care , they replied very smartly -- " We would like to clarify that the difference of amount reversed on your card account towards the petrol transaction is due to service tax component of the transaction. For all eligible transactions, the surcharge and service tax gets reversed to the card account as and when the transaction is done. We also do our periodic internal checks to ensure the same. In the rare instance when the service component is not reversed, we ensure necessary corrective action is taken at our end.

Worst experience with Regelia card service. While taking the card,  big promises were made that value added services and customer service is best you can get. Have been following up with call center for 1 month on the apparently free Taj membership and air insurance nomination. No one has an answer and keeps providing different useless solutions. And no following up to even see of the problem had been solved! I truly special. A special idiot to take this card.|2015-09-22T16:54:13+0000

Dear Team,  Very sorry to say that your internet banking facilities are rotten like hell. Reason is simple I am not able to make any payments since 15 days using your glorified internet banking facilities. A month ago I had faced similar kind of problem after going to Kestopure Branch of Hdfc my problem was solved.If I had to go to branch of Hdfc kestopure then I will prefer to close the account,since it is of no use to invest time in this affair.

Hi, I would like to bring to your notice that I have had a terrible experience with HDFC. I have been speaking to one of the employees of your bank (Ms. Anjali) and have been discussing about a personal loan which I wanted to take. After sharing all the documents, I get to know that the information shared were wrong. I was told that the tenure for the personal loan payment will be 5 years and based on that the EMI was comfortable for me. But today (when the loan was supposed to processed after my mail confirmation), she tells me that the tenure would be 4 years which automatically increases my EMI amount. More than 2 weeks  have been wasted on this plus my time. How can you take your customers for granted?? Moreover to top it all, nobody even bothers to apologize. What kind of service is this?|2015-09-22T11:43:09+0000
Hi,    This is Abhishek Raskar here from Pune.   My credit card number is: 4346781016370892.  My mobile number is: 8806892121.  I was shocked and surprised when I opened my bill this month! I was charged a fine of Rs. 400/- and some interest of around Rs. 145/- in the bill!  So I called the customer care at: 020-61606161.  I called the customer care on: 19/9/2015 at 12:14 PM.  The woman on the phone representing HDFC bank was VERY RUDE. So I asked her to transfer the call to a senior manager and she literally refused to do so, saying that there was no manager free at the moment! Consider this as her feedback and initiate action against her, and if this continues I will terminate my HDFC card and go for some other bank.  Now, coming to my actual problem - She informed me that Rs. 400/- was late payment charge and Rs. 145/- was interest - BUT I WAS APPALLED!  I did NOT get the bill on my email and neither did I get any SMS on my cell phone!!! Then how does your bank expect me to pay the money I owe?   I request you to look into the matter. I have paid the minimum dues, but I will not pay the late fee and interest. So I request you to waive off the extra charges so that I can pay off my remaining dues.   AGAIN NOTE THAT I DID NOT PAY THE BILL SINCE I WAS UNAWARE OF IT. MAKE SURE THAT I DO GET EMAIL AND SMS UPDATES REGULARLY SO THAT I AM REMINDED TO PAY MY BILL FROM TIME TO TIME.  Revert at the earliest. You can call me on 8806892121 or reply to this email id too.|2015-09-22T11:40:43+0000

Worst experience with HDFC Mahape branch. They say signature don't match, needs checque-book.  1. To have cheque-book you have to apply on netbanking, otherwise they    don't take instant debit card application. Polcies.  2. Made to wait half an hour in free bank opening time. Manager don't even look at signatures and say he has other task than to open my account and see my signatures. 3 .Change of signature will take 4 days. 4. Then apply for Debit card and it will take another 4 days. 5. No proof of identity is valid for them. 6. He offered me withdrawal money and says "this is 2nd time " as if I am doing wrong taking my oney When I lost my temper, he says to me mind my language "nahi toh bank se bahar niaklwa dunga".  8 years been with this bank, I am now planning to switch my account because of this Mahape,Navi Mumbai branch and its manager named Kothari.|2015-09-22T07:07:13+0000

No words for our customer care no. it’s not only tough while impossible to connect with you executive. They must be free for whole day as no one able to connect with your tough CC process.  My issue is- I have account in your bank. My Cust ID is: 60527358. Name: Arvind Kumar. Acc-50100088331304 It was a salary account and there is no credit in my account since june. Recently I have change the job and now my salary will be credited in the same account. But I have received the message from bank that “if no salary credit in August benefit will be withdrawn from 1st sept”  So please suggest because my salary will be credited in 1st of oct 2015. Any charges your going to take kindly mention. I request you to hold the decision for this month because my salary will start credited constant from next month onwards.|2015-09-22T07:05:30+0000

Horrible Netbanking UI & Customer support from HDFC.   I've been facing problems with the Netbanking of Multi-Currency Forex card for more than a month. Tried calling customer care, didn't help. It's been more than a week since I raised my issue to support@hdfc.com and hardly any help seems to be forthcoming.  Apart from false promises and tall claims, nothing of value has been done yet. Things as basic as checking the card statement online or updating the email address are not working. Refund doesn't get processed and the Netbanking UI is completely kaput.  Calling up the HDFC customer support is an utter waste of time as well. The customer care agents either don't answer the call and in case they do, they imply that the customer is lying by claiming that they don't see anything wrong from their end. They also compel the customers to use IE8 or 9. FYI, these are obsolete browsers. A customer simply cant be compelled to use obsolete browsers to check his account statement. In hindsight, although I fell into the trap of getting a forex account opened, I feel awfully lucky that I haven't opened up a banking account with HDFC  Are these the standards of support that HDFC aspire to ?  A downright disgrace to say the very least! I shall see to it that this matter is escalated to the higher echelons if possible.|2015-09-22T06:37:40+0000

This is really frustrating. All the customer service executive giving different different information and wrong information and disconnecting the call deliberately upon asking the clarifications. I took one policy from HDFC bank and i was told cancellation is very easy. Now i want to cancel the policy and they are routing me to multiple channels. this was one thing. Other wrong information was given about airport lounge access. I was told that access is free and this was iterated multiple time by multiple executive    .After checking the policy i got to know its chargeable and i called CC again stating what i found in the policy then only that person accepted. I was very satisfied with HDFC bank so far but not it seems to be frustrating.|2015-09-22T05:41:55+0000

Very bad experience with HDFC bank, and Viman Nagar Branch, Pune.  The bank took 1 and half month to open my account and further 3 weeks for net banking and debit card details. Debit card OTP failed at ATM due to some technical issues, and when you call the customer care, you need to have TPIN or debit PIN else you can't proceed, I don't know how come first time user will have PIN/TPIN. Complaints are taken only during office hours. Branch employees are taught well to do promises but would never do things on time. Some of the nationalised banks are better than HDFC.|2015-09-22T02:12:35+0000

Hi Team,  I am unhappy with your services which you're providing to me on credit card (Times card). I have seen few good competitors of yours provide good customer service by making their customers entertain with EMI options when the customer requires. But, wherein if I see with your service which is provided to me is not up to the expectation and not even a EMI option I can get from you when I wish. However,  I want you to convert the payable amount to monthly EMI.  Also, about my instant loan service I would like to let you know that I was very happy to get loan amount of Rs.12,000 from you which came reached me with the credit card. But the saddest part is you were never informed me when should I pay it and if I don't pay at right time what would be the concern.  Please note once after I spoke with customer care executive I came to know that I should have sufficient amount on 29th if not I would be charged interested for not having Sufficient amount in my account.  Now I have got some useless offers along my bill which is ridiculous and nowadays you're not serving the customers properly.   Unsatisfied customer|2015-09-21T19:14:01+0000

Dear HDFC Bank,  Please help me understand a few things, since your digital agency seems much more efficient than your banking services.  You call me 3-7 times a day to sell me meaningless shit like discounts on movie tickets. But when I have a genuine issue, why does it take 8 days for me to finally get through to a customer service executive?   I have been on the phone everyday listening to the fact that you have been chosen as India's Best Bank, waiting for over 15 minutes on every call I've made, and to no avail. (Over that, I am charged for these calls).   I try to call my concerned branch and they don't have a working phone for over a week. They realise it's not working, once I'm AT the branch, calling the phone IN FRONT of the personal banker. To top this all, your personal banker tells me it is 'not her problem' and that I have to 'learn to wait'. She is not in a position, however, to detail how long I should wait for. But hats off to her, for she doesn't forget to reiterate before I leave- "5% off on bookmyshow tickets, ma'am!"  Please remind me dear HDFC Bank, why am I paying you to manage my money when it costs me a whole lot more to manage my relationship with you?|2015-09-21T13:19:54+0000

Had a credit card from HDFC that got upgraded three months back. without any request. Bills and notifications stopped coming through completely. On request through Customer care got a bill with late payment and finance charges slapped. next month no bills again. On request again, a new bill with late + fin charges. Is this the new modus- operandi of bank ?? completely horrified with the service. Looks like a new way to make some fast money with customers|2015-09-21T12:36:40+0000

hdfc is waste bank i have ever seen because when the salary account is kept ideal for long time it converts into saving account without intimating the customer. every customer may not know what is the bank norms so either the bank representatives must educated the customer  at the time the account is created or at time the account was not maintained wit mimimum balance. this reflects that the bank tries to made money from poor customers ..and not bothered abt the customers..|2015-09-21T10:17:29+0000

What is the process to closing the salaried account in HDFC bank?|2015-09-21T08:06:23+0000
I am account holder of HDFC since last 10 years & overall satisfied with qualities of its bare minimum services offered to its customers!!! But there are still some problems of arrogant behaviour of the Bank itself & its branch officials.  Since last 2 years I am getting e-mails from frequesnt e-mails of KYC updation for reason as I have already done it long ago!!! I think for HDFC Bank  is very easy to harrass its customers with repeated KYC e-mails as it doesn't COST them to do so but about the COST that its customers are forced to pay each time for KYC updation!!! May be HDFC Bank should go through below COST of KYC updation that each customer has to pay:  1) Three colour photo: 15 Rs 2) Xerox copies of various documents: Rs 10 Cost of half day leave for going to Bank to submit & verification of the same documents: Open Number!!!  Why customer should pay these costs each & everytime for no fault his/her???  If I am correct as per Newspaper news, some 2 years back HDFC Bank was fined Rs 5 Crs along with other Banks due to frauds done by theirs Branch Officials while opening accounts of theirs new customers & verification of the KYC documents...& all this happened due failure of the HDFC Bank & its Branch officials to follow & adhere the Banking Procedures in true spirit but cost of theirs this failure has to paid by other law abiding customers...why SO??? If one consider the total nos of the HDFC Bank customers then one can imagine the kind of Big amount the all the customers of the HDFC Bank need to pay each time from their own pocket for no fault?? As some branch officials of the HDFC Bank follow corrupt work practices & innocent & law abiding customers like has to pay the price of theirs corrupt behaviour & work practices for no reason!!! Great HDFC Bank please keep it up by allowing such a high standards of corrupt work practices of your few Branch Officials & please keep on forcing each customer Rs 50 to Rs 100/- from theirs own pocket for frequent KYC updation!!!   Today I tried to explain about these costs of thye frequent KYC updations etc to officials of the HDFC Bank Branch at Solapur,,,the so called knowledgeable HDFC Bank Branch official was very rude in his behaviour & simply told me that he don't have TIME to answer my queries regarding these costs of KYC updation!!!|2015-09-21T08:01:26+0000

I had taken a car loan from HDFC but when the loan got over I got to know that I need to pay some extra amount as my check bounced. All I know is that I paid the money to there executive as soon as they called me and as far as I remember I always had sufficient funds in my account. Still I was ready to pay the remaining money but not they ask me to come to their headoffic and pay it there, when they wanted money on my loan they could collect it from my home then why not this time.

Hi.. There is a complaint against the bank. I don't know where else to say  so posting here.  As I have an account in hdfc bank, I dropped a cheque in karapakkam branch, Chennai in the month of June. The cheque got bounce and as per the RULE of the bank they courier the cheque to my address.. In the mean while the person who gave me the cheque had asked me to return the cheque so that he can give me the money in cash. I queried in the bank after that and came to know they have courier it to my residential address i.e in Jamshedpur. After waiting for a month I  called the phone banking no. only to know the fact that cheque have not reached. So I asked them to give me the cheque in karapakkam branch. They gave me assurance that I will get my cheque back and asked me to collect the cheque after 7working days. I went to the branch after 10-12 working days and come to know that they have not received any cheque. And the trouble start after that. After a month follow up I just come to know that they have lost the cheque. They are blaming the courier service and now I have lost my money because of some irresponsibility at bank side. They are saying that they will issue some no payment certificate. I don't know what to do.|2015-09-20T19:00:27+0000

What to know all the inner jobs happening in HDFC.. read this..seriously i wasted so much energy calling and mailing them.. not even a slight positive response.. all i got was a robotic mail. which i already knew. they didnt even look up into the issue. Please stay aware of this all customers in HDFC.   3 Months ago i got a call from HDFC. The person said "sir we are giving every free policy for all HDFC bank credit card holders". I immediately said "i dont need , not interested" then that person said "no sir , as this is a offer we are giving for free for all HDFC credit card holders , if you dont want u can cancel it later by calling back and you wont be charged anything." Then the person was like "sir this is very useful plan. u can use services from many hospitals for free just by using our policy card and so on." then the person started explaining the charges "you will be charged a total of 7800(not perfect value) in installments for 2 years. the money will be blocked from my credit card and will be taken as EMI" then i asked so for 2 years 8000 odd money will be blocked from credit card and i cant use it so my credit limit will get less" then that person said " no sir, as this is a policy hdfc is offering for its customer ur credit limit wont be affected. It will be like extra 8000 rs added to your credit limit. that is like ur credit limit will be unchanged and you will just have to play the monthy 350 installment for 2 years. and if you dont use the services at all for 2 years you will be paid back with interest around 1k. you will be receiving 2k as interest for the 2 years u paid. or you can also continue the policy and extend it or if you dont want the policy u can cancel it before 3 months of free cost. all the money charged will be refunded to u fully. Then i asked for conformation the same thing again and the lady who spoke said the same thing. Then i said ok. ill take the policy. then the person said " ok sir so i take this as yes and i will process. now you will receive a call from the policy people and they will ask you if u want to take the policy. just say yes. if you have any doubts ask me. as they will call only to confim the policy "  then i said ok.i dont have any doubts and cut the call"  then in a gap of 2 minutes i get another call the person in the call said "sir just now someone would have talking to u explaining the policy , did u understand everything. i am just repeating everything for your clarification" and he repeated everything the first person (the lady) said. and asked me if i had any doubt. I said "ok no doubts" and then he said ok sir. then in sometime you will receive a call from the policy people. say that you are taking the policy and cuts call.  around 15 to 20 minutes later. i get a call. The person on call says "hi sir we are calling from hdfc ergo" are you willing to take the health policy offered to you" i said yes. then he said " ok now i will explain you the terms" and starts explaining me the terms what he said was " you will be charged this amount and this will be taken from your credit card and you wil be paying it as emi. and if you want u can call and cancel it in 15 days for free of charge. and then asked me if i wanted to take the policy and i said yes. and therefore i was provided the HDFC ERGO health policy.  After 10 days i notice that 8000rs has been taken from credit card from my credit limit and then i call ergo and say this is the issue. the customer care said sir how is it possible. it will obviously be deducted. and there is not like u will have extra 8000 limit. just for health policy. then i told you people only told me. and then he said no sir we dont give such commitments. if you want file a complaint we will check the call recording and see if our people gave such wrong information. then i raised a complaint and then after some days i was sent the voice recording and i checked it. It was the voice recording of the person who called me from ergo to confirm my policy and not those 2 people who initially talked to me and then i called customer care again and said the same and this is what he said " no sir thats the only call we made from our we didnt not make any other calls. and we dont have any history of it." then  i argue for some more time and then i said ok cancel my policy. he said ok i will cancel your policy but you will be charged the processing fee of 300 and the first month emi and i then said this also. you people only said its free of cost as it was given by bank and then he said no sir there is no such thing then i just didnt know waht to do and thought to go on and stop as i knew this was total fraud.  in between i made more than 10 calls between hdfc ergo and hdfc credit card customer care for this and both of them denied the call. The credit card people said we dont do calls it must be only ergo. and ergo people said check with credit card people. wasted my time and energy. caused so much stress.  then the next day i get a call and a lady speaks "sir i am calling from HDFC bank , it seems that u are cancelling your ergo policy may i know the reason and i said the whole thing that happened then the lady said no sir its not so. you will receive full refund. we are from "HDFC FINANCE TEAM" the policy is given to you by the bank if you ask this to the ergo customer care they wont have any idea of it as its given by the bank to its customers and she said if u cancel the policy directly you will be charged and then she said you have to raise the cancellation from the bank side so that we will process the cancellation and we will provide u the full refund. and i also told about the credit limit what the first person told and she also denied such thing and then i told cancel the policy. then she told ok "U CANCEL THE REQUEST U RAISED FOR CANCELLATION ON ERGO" ill raise cancellation from the bank side so that you will receive full refund and then she said as you are raising cancellation from bank side it will take 3 months and after 3 months you will receive full refund. i said ok and then cut the call.  3 months passed and i didnt find any changes in my account. my credit limit was still less and no refund was done and then few days back i call hdfc ergo customer care and asked if my policy was cancelled and that person said no sir its not cancelled as you said not to cancel on 30th may the day the lady said u have to raise cancellation from bank side. i was really so pissed off. i shouted and then there is nothing i could have done. i then again raised the cancellation and now i lose around 2000 rs for 4 months emi and processing charge. well played by the fraud BANK. good way to take money from the customers.  and recently when i was talking about this incident in my office , my collegues also stood up suddenly and said the same thing. they also called and told such things and now if i call ergo they are telling u wont be refunded and everyone also have raised cancellation of their policy and lose around 1500 to 2000rs. I dont know how many more people wer told such things and double played.  I also mailed this incident to hdfc. i dont think ill receive anything positive. I want my full money bank. and its not just me who was affected. there are people who also faced the same thing and if the BANK denies such thing then is it that we people are stupid ? to take a policy and then cancel it after 3 or 4 months and lose 1500 rs for waste ? what is the use.  and i bet there will be lot of people like me who called ergo and asked the same thing and they denied that they didnt not say that they will give full refund. total bullshit from the bank side.|2015-09-19T13:58:43+0000

I am a credit card holder of HDFC bank...and was pleased to have one . But now it seems the quality of the phone banking team has deteriorated a lot. I requested for a change in my billing cycle and it's been  15 days that I have heard anything from the bank. On 17th September I called again and they informed that the bank have tried to call me but it was not reachable. They informed that I would receive a call and within a day or two my request would be closed. Today again when I called ...the executive told me that I have to write a letter in a plain paper and inform the bank that I want a change in the cycle. After I told her that this is an utter harassment to the customer and wanted to speak to her supervisor..she made me wait for half an hour and the line got disconnected....u pride yourself being the Best bank in Asia and India ....you are making  the customers feel otherwise.....absolutely disheartening service ...|2015-09-19T13:44:41+0000

Application number : 56380 This is in regards to the 'interest rate' and the 'tenure' committed by your representative at the time when we agreed to take loan from HDFC Bank. I was been advised that the interest rate would be at 11.25% and for a tenure of 10 years. If you go through my previous complaint your representative made me wait for more than 2 months for a job which could have been done within 1 months time & caused so much of trauma and inconvenience for us we are the ones who had to constantly call and followup with the status of the loan, their have been instances we have made 10 calls a day and your representative dint revert or have the slightest courtesy to leave a message that he was busy and would call me later. Even if we did get through to him and ask the status on regular interval he would say that he is not handling only our loan and needs to work on other loan as well wow! ( and hat the loan is in Process) i was really amazed with this prompt reply of his and wondered if this is how HDFC Bank treat its customers. Biggest disappointment was after waiting for 1 whole month and finally fed up with your representative had to log a complaint and then to our shock we got to know that our was not even logged in for processing.   To put it in short i have waited for this loan for more than 2 months and now when the loan is finally approved the interest rate in not at 11.25% but at 12% which is really disappointing and also the tenure should have been for 10 years instead of 15 years.   Kindly would request you to look into this and provide with a solution as we are tired of all this and have no patience anymore.|2015-09-19T10:25:00+0000

Hi, this is real pathetic service from HDFC. The horrible cust care service execs hound u for a credit card and after taking the  docs, dont even bother to deliver it even after repeated requests and follow ups.

I had one of the worst experiences with HDFC Bank today.  I had recently applied for an HDFC Money back Credit Card, 5459 6489 0061 4588. At the time of sale, HDFC executives told me that the credit card is free for lifetime and gave various other offers. They did not mention anything about a Health Card at the time of sale.  Within a few days, I started getting calls from HDFC asking if I had received a Health card along with the credit card. They told me about the Health Card/Insurance offer and I refused to avail it THRICE to three different executives. I also told them I had not received the PIN for my CREDIT CARD to which they only replied that it had been dispatched. I still haven’t received my PIN and almost 2 months have passed.  After that, I had one of the worst experiences offered by HDFC bank.   Their executive called me today and forced me to take their same cashless health insurance plan. I told him how I had refused to avail this service earlier and he said that it is mandatory if I don’t have a personal mediclaim policy.  I said I didn’t want one and he started claiming that I had to buy it and now my first monthly instalment of Rs 300 is already due. I refused to pay and said that they had cheated me as they never mentioned it at the time of sale. He said it doesn’t matter and insulted me for not having a personal policy(They do not consider the company Mediclaim policy) and arguing as other HDFC customers didn’t mind paying the money. He said that his department is different from sale and it is not his responsibility.  Then I asked him to cancel my credit card, to which he replied that I would have to pay Rs. 2500. I asked him to give me some time to reply and he said he couldn’t wait for me as he did not have time for my file. They would again call me after 3 months only and by then I would have to pay Rs 7500 to cancel it.  Now Rs 10,000 have been blocked on my card as I was fooled into buying their health insurance plan. The executive simply told me that I had signed for it and now I would have to pay this amount or the installments, disregarding all the statements I made.  This has been by far one of the worst banking experiences I have ever faced. I ALSO GOT TO KNOW ABOUT EXACTLY THE SAME INCIDENT TAKING PLACE 3 WEEKS BACK WITH MY FRIEND – Saurabh Kothari. Is this is how you sell your products?   Please let me know the procedure of cancelling the card.  I am not liable to pay anything for it and I will not pay anything. I would recommend to others to never buy HDFC Credit cards unless they want to face such harrowing experiences.   Please look into the matter on an urgent basis. I am extremely disappointed in you guys.  P.S. - I had received the call today from +911409580344. The credit card was delivered to me on 30 July 2015.|2015-09-18T15:48:07+0000

Hi HDFC,  I am a happy HDFC customer until July 29 and one wrong HDFC support person screwed my life and I don't find any solution until now.  1) I have called HDFC customer care to check how long it takes for the voucher to be used once i submit the request and they have told me immediately. I have asked her again since i am using this voucher for flight tickets and it wont be valid if i get after a day or two. After her confirmation i have requested for Yatra vouchers  2) I didn't get any vouchers for 1-2 hours so i have called the customer care again and now different person pick the call and clarified me that it takes 3-5 working days so i have asked him to cancel my voucher. He opened the ticket on the same day (15211152632)  3) But i have received the voucher after 2 days so i have called again to cancel the voucher by explaining the past and at the time they said you dont need to open a new ticket since your old one is in progress. After approval someone from HDFC will come and collect the vouchers and credit the points back to your account.  4) I dont see any progress for 1 week so i have called again and this person said its still in progress and HDFC dont need to come & collect the vouchers, it will be automatically cancelled and the points will be redeemed back to your account.  5) But today i received a call from your voucher team asking am i happy with the vouchers and she said we can't cancel already provided vouchers. She asked me to call again the phone banking for more information  6) After i call the phone banking officer, he asked me to send a mail to this id to provide the history of this incident.  7) After submitting the email, i got 2 tickets ( 15211152632 & 15231535853) but no progress for 3 weeks then i called the manager and he is not agreed to my points. So i have provided the proof that HDFC sent the wrong vouchers and mentioned the same in the courier.  8) After close to 2 months of the incident i am still stuck without proper solution.  As a loyal customer with HDFC now i dont have a choice other than cancel my card.|2015-09-18T09:00:17+0000

Hello HDFC Bank,  Your services are pathetic..... I recieved my Diner Club credit card on 5th Sep,2015 but till date it is not activated. I m calling customer care on daily basis but they are not solving my problem and always authenticating me through one time OTP but not given any suitable solution. If this is the way to treat your customer then m sorry but HDFC bank services are bullshit. How government gives you best Financial Bank of the Year. You are the worst bank in india. If you dont want to activate my card then please take your card back. I dont need it anymore.  My credit card number is- 36088620714744 Name- Rahul Aggarwal Phone- 9818545180|2015-09-18T05:55:54+0000
The most disappointing experience banking with HDFC- you call yourself an international standard Bank and your service is worse than a local bank!!! I had applied for a regalia card, as I was travelling to Europe. My date of departure is today and they say my card will come in a couple of days from now. The application for this card was done more than a month ago!!! Thanks hdfc for single handedly spoiling my trip. And on being questioned, your staff has nothing but excuses. The manager roopshah is the most incompetent lady I have seen. The branch manager also had no response on being questioned as to why my card had not reached me. This incompetence has happened in the lokhandwala branch of andheri West, Mumbai.  I want to ask you @hdfc- is your staff just disinterested or plain lazy??? Best to cancel my savings account from your bank.|2015-09-18T05:36:42+0000
Hi  I have written before too, regarding my credit card issue, its more than a week still waiting my issue to be resolved, my reference Id is Ref ID:FB080915152.  When I post this last time, I was saying to drop an email on talktous@hdfcbank.com, when I mailed on this mail, I just get a call from phone bankers and they told me that they are going to process of downgrade my credit card, and they told me that this will be happen soon, now its more than a week,  and I again drop an email to get any update, no one is replying from talktous@hdfcbank.com. I dont know why, who will tell me the status of my credit card.  Really I was thinking HDFC is best among others, but these all going me make unhappy with HDFC.   I dont know why this is taking too much time. I need my credit card solution witin 2-3 days.  Please when you read this post just reply fast or call me to let me know whether my card is in process or not and how much time it will taken exactly.    Again if HDFC ignores to listen customers problem then it will loss the business as everyone wish to switch to another bank rather than HDFC bank.  Waiting to get response fast.  Thanks, Gurdeep Singh|2015-09-18T05:09:43+0000
Hi I m Dr Ruchi Rathore and I have been using your doctors super is credit card for last 2/3 years without any complains and have been paying my bills on time   but NOW YOU GUYS suddenly upgraded my card and blocked my old card without informing me ... Then you put late charges for not paying the bill when I did not receive any bill for that month ... Not only that I had made a payment for the July bill generated on 14 July on 20 July itself as reflected in my bank statement . But this payment was agin asked from me in August and now added with the September bill along with late fee charges levied on me . Despite the fact that I have made double payment for the same ... Kindly unblock my card , revert my late fee charhes and the extra payment to you guys and do not torcher with customer care calls without clearing your own facts !!!!! And ya not to forget your customer care guys have been referring someother card number for the same too !!!!!!!!!!!|2015-09-18T03:54:15+0000

HDFC Smart Buy is the most unprofessional and unethical organization i have seen. I booked a  air ticket through their  portal on 22 July 2015 and had to abort the ticket  which i did. I received a conformation mail from them on the same day saying the amount would be refunded within 7 working days. I have been waiting since then they haven't refunded the amount. I think they have made it their business to  earn the money through fraudulent means.Moreover the way they handle their customers is arrogant.I suggest in fact request every1 not to use this fraudulent portal.|2015-09-17T19:08:40+0000

I have my salary account in HDFC Kalina Branch, Mumbai. Today at around 2 p.m I have received a message that a cheque of 40,000 was debited from my account to somebody's account whom I dont even know. There was 15000 in my account and the balance was shown as -25000.  I called the customer care and the questions they were asking were not sensible. They were asking to check with my family and if I forgot that I have given a cheque to someone.  After asking him for many times, he has forwarded it to Mr.Swapnil of Kalina branch. He told it is a holiday and nothing can be done till tomorrow. He was not even trying to help me. I asked him the number of the branch manager for seeking some help. He was very adamant.   Finally we have got the number of Ms.Megha who is the branch manager. She was even more stubborn to help and told nothing can be done and it was her holiday.She even hung up on me.  I was in a state of shock after getting the message and was seeking for help. But HDFC only promises to be at customer's help 24/7 but what I have experienced is pathetic.  After an hour I have received a message that the transaction failed due to insufficient balance. That means if I had sufficient balance my hard earned money would have been transferred to somebody else's account. And HDFC doesn't even help.  First thing I don't understand is, when I have my cheque book with me, how can a cheque be cleared? Is the person who has cleared the cheque sleeping such that he cannot match the signature with mine? They only boast about their brand being the most valuable, but don't recognise that the value comes from their customers. Nobody else can rely on HDFC now. I can never trust them and plead all the HDFC customers to be careful.  Second, being the 2nd biggest private bank in India, how can you not help customers when they are in need of you? If thats the service they bring to the table then i have no words.|2015-09-17T17:37:01+0000

This is a service complaint regarding replacement of a defective product purchased using HDFC Credit Card reward points. I have a HDFC credit card (last 4 - 48X2) and in the month of July'2015, I used my reward points to purchase a Panasonic Cordless phone from your reward catalogue.   Within a month, the phone stopped working and the phone could not be produced at the Panasonic service centre as they demanded a bill (which as per your executives you do not issue the bill to the customer if the product is purchased using reward points) and a warranty card. Upon complaining the same to your executive on September 2, I am informed that the device will be replaced within 7 working days.  After a few days of not receiving any feedback from you, I called back the customer care(on September 8) only to realize that the process will take 15 more working days? The reason I am told is the vendor of HDFC Credit card is not responding in spite of their repeated follow ups and that the customer has to suffer for 15 more days. The executive informed me to reach out to customerservices.cards@hdfcbank.com if I wanted a speedy resolution on this issue and as suggested when I wrote to them on September 9( Complaint Number 'HBL=031-198-398') I received a templated response  (Response- We observe from our records that your query raised through phone banking towards replacement is under review and upon completion intimation will be given.) and when I write back detailing the issue complaining to them that waiting for a month for a replacement is pathetic and in spite of asking them not to provide any more generic responses and to seriously look into this matter, I receive another templated response on  14 September. - (With reference to your query.We like to inform you that pick up and replacement will be processed within 15 working days.)   I request HDFC to take serious note of this issue and STOP MISLEADING customers about the benefits of reward points when you can't keep up your promises of delivering quality product/ replacing a defective product effectively. Are we talking about one of the Top 5 Banks in India?? And why is the customer being made to wait for HDFC's inability to keep track of its quality vendors?   I am hoping for a "NON TEMPLATED" response to this concern and also a speedy resolution on this issue. What baffles me is a wait time of A MONTH to REPLACE a defective product when we are talking of times of improved customer service time! If it is so difficult for HDFC to service this request, I would suggest you to credit the reward points back to my credit card and issue a letter in written claiming your INCAPABILITY in resolving this issue.  Thanks.|2015-09-17T14:26:35+0000
Hi HDFC, please explain why people are calling me saying they are from HDFC bank and asking me to confirm my bank details by stating some data. I have gotten a call previously as well and I have asked them not to call me again. I got a call from this number just now: +91 140 930 3635. Truecaller also identifies the number as HDFC. Why am I getting such calls? Please look into this matter ASAP. Thank you.|2015-09-17T12:46:14+0000

Disappointment !  I have been using HDFC credit card since last 4 years. Got it renewed just now. Not yet activated. Called minimum 5 times to your customer care dept. 2nd time the executive said that it is now activated! However , the card is still not activated. Even after providing all the details for the verification my card is still not activated. It has been 15 days now. Is this your way to treat loyal consumers ? This is very frustrating and disappointing !! I have been chasing your so called promt customer care dept since three days now. Sad that ther still is no improvement !|2015-09-17T10:06:39+0000
I am extremely disappointed with the customer service of HDFC in recent years as every time I had to pay for the careless mistakes of their various teams ( locker team, credit card team). A few years back they had even clubbed my account with unknown people to form Imperia Family Group. So watch out everyone !And every time the customer was always asked to compromise instead of accountability being fixed on their staff. Their services have really declined.  Just last month the principal amount of my FDs were altered without my authorisation. I have been escalating the matter at different levels only to meet with extreme disappointment every time.  I am not satisfied with the resolution of the Grievance Redressal Officer. Instead of giving a fair resolution after thorough investigation, the careless action of the HDFC Taxation team is being covered. The principal amounts of my FDs were broken by their team without my knowledge to recover taxes when there was sufficient balance in my account to recover the taxes from there. This is totally unacceptable.   I have now escalated the matter with the a Principal Nodal Officer. And I will continue to escalate the matter as far as possible and even go to the Consumer's Court if needed to demand answers and claim damages. As a customer, I feel insecure about my investments with you now and have lost faith in HDFC.  I will be addressing the matter in my Consumer Rights Blog too http://rightsall.blogspot.in|2015-09-17T09:33:40+0000

Highly Disappointed with the customer care service of this bank. I have raised a complaint regarding my credit card of this bank and when I call to them, they took 10-15 minutes after this when they have no answer of my query than they transferred my call to their senior and it's going on and when I asked to raise a complaint against the employees of the customer care than they are not giving me their details to do that and they said that is not in their policy. Even I am using ICICI credit card also and I never got this type of service from them.|2015-09-17T06:15:00+0000

HDFC is now deducting money silently and unethically from deposits. I bet that HDFC is an unsafe place to keep your money. I would recommend users to exercise caution if you choose sign up with HDFC. I feel today is indeed an auspicious day to withdraw all your deposits and move your account elsewhere. Happy Ganesh Chaturthi!|2015-09-17T05:07:44+0000

I m calling customer care on daily basis but they are not solving my problem and always authenticating me through one time OTP but not given any suitable solution. If this is the way to treat your customer then m sorry but HDFC bank services are bullshit. How government gives you best Financial Bank of the Year. You are the worst bank in india.

Hello HDFC Bank ForEx Users,  This is my experience, on 6th Aug and 7th Aug 2015, three fraud transactions happened and the total value is $1096.7 USD.  I registered a complaint on 12th Aug 2015 and as per HDFC bank advice, registered local police complaint in Pittsburg USA.  I’ve sent all necessary documents proofs along with the local police complaint document and dispute form to “Charge Back HDFC Bank Division, Mumbai Office”.  Till now they did not respond properly, the customer care folks keep on saying wait for next five working days or three working days. Almost 30 days gone, still HDFC bank did not share the investigation progress status or caseworker details or contact numbers.  I never used the give card online or I never made any high value transactions, it is bank responsibility to stop high value transactions if the card user does not made any such high value transactions before.  The HDFC ForEx card is an unsafe to use. The customer care division is very bad.  Any of you had bad experience in past, please share your experience and let me know how to proceed further. I've no choice now; still I’ve little hope with HDFC. In case they continue or drag with no reason then I may have to go legally.  Manikandan|2015-09-17T02:29:05+0000

Hi HDFC, I an not sure if you guys are open to receive feedback on Facebook, however I really wanted to Highlight one of my recent unfruitful and irritating experiences with you. I never believed in net banking. however after multiple texts and mails from you to pursue me to set up online banking for safe transactions, I decided to set up an acct online. first of all, Your net banking registration process for credit cards is quite easy(if you have all the info needed). However I had to call your inadequate customer service center for help. first I spoke to one of the reps who sounded a little irritated and  uninterested, and the tone was not pleasant. he however, as I thought at that time managed to resolve the issue. To set up card pin he asked me to visit the nearest hdfc ATM. while setting up the pin I realized that the OTAP sent was 6 digits and ATM would only accept 4 digit temp pin. isn't that Smart.??? I tried to call your Customer services again as I was not able to set up the ATM pin with Otap sent. after going through never ending IVR verification and repetitive menus call was connected to one of your good for nothing advisers to put the call on mute and eventually disconnected after 7 mins. And all of this happens after 12 in the midnight. I have never had better experience in the past, and some how you guys just keep reminding me that I still have choice to choose better.|2015-09-16T20:53:23+0000
Hello HDFC Bank,  I did an IMPS transaction to a beneficiary account few minutes back. The money got debited and didn't credit to his account. I called HDFC customer care and they said to wait for 1 day to transaction to fail. I am stuck and need to transfer money but can't use it. What kind of bank is it that doesn't let me use my money as per IMPS , when I need it urgently and that too due to a technical failure from bank side.   Worst ever banking experience.

Dear HDFC Bank, you guys are really stupid people to bank upon.  I was having a credit card from HDFC which was not pin enabled. So I dropped an application in your drop box to get a pin enabled card. In the meanwhile I shifted to a different address. So the new card was never received.  I did received a few call from your customer care center stating that the card is undelivered . They ensured that they will send someone to get my signature on the address change form, but no one did actually came.  Late I called in to your 01161606161 no The person said you can that a printout of application form and drop it in ATM dropbox, which i did. But nothing happened.  Then again i called in after 20 days, another associate of yours told me to login to Saving acc netbanking and go to address change option and upload the attested document, which i did. And again next day got an sms that the request was not processed.  Then again i called in to see if anything else can be done. the lady told me that there is not option to change address online through net banking. She asked me to courier address application to chennai (why do i spend money on courier). So out of frustration i asked her to close my credit card. She told me that 201 rs is due on your end. And the processed the closed through OTP. then i paid the 201 outstanding through ATm Machine.  Now I called in again today to see if this has been closed or not. The next person told me that it has been temporary blocked. and no outstanding is due. But to get it permanently blocked you have to send the Card in four piece to Chennai along with application to close account. he also told me that if i don't send it then my CIBIL with get effected ,, what the earth is this, if no due is there, you guys are trying to harass people.  Now why the lady didn't told me this.  Go and check my credit card record, there was never any late payment or interest occurred, you guys really lost a good customer.  I hope you will lose many......  I will prefer not to use HDFC services ever.  you guys can call 10 times a day if an new card or loan is required, but will never help if any problem occurs to any existing customer. Try helping the old customer also, ,, otherwise you guys will keep losing and new customer will never come....  call me if you need anything on this. KUNAL, C.ID: 43993731|2015-09-16T14:17:06+0000

Great apathy of HDFC in taking action on client complaint of mine.

Is reminder and follow-up is the other name of HDFC ? We receive so many calls in our mobiles and SMS to avail credit cards and loans but to get response to the deposits we place with them we have to send so many e mail but still wait endlessly for reply  I have sent 3 reminders in the last 15 days to get response to my GOI bonds which mautres on 25th of this month. I  details of my  communications copied as follows  No one in HDFC is listening ?  This is the status when our Govts talks abt more free eocnomy and papers less investments.

Hi,  I am Mr Ajay kothare, customer of your esteemed bank.  I received a bill amt of Rs. 49,833/- INR for Titanium HDFC Card Number (2870) dtd 15-Jul-2014. I paid the amt of Rs. 9,000 INR by cash on dt 23-July-2014. Thereafter I wanted to pay the Total pending amt (Full and Final Payment), thus I made a call to your customer service executive upon which I was told that my total balance (Full and Final amt) is Rs. 40,833/- INR and upon paying which I will be getting Full and Final receipt after credit of sum. The very next instant I paid Rs. 40,833/- INR by cheque.  Details of paid cheque: Cheque Dtd: 14-Aug-2014 Bank: State Bank of India  Chq No: 694 949 Rs 40,833  This cheque has been credited to your account.Still I have'nt received the Full and Final receipt of the deposited amt. I have been in constant follow up with customer care, still I did not get any response and I havent used my card eversince then.   Thereafter, I called up on Numbers- 6160 6161/ 28564332/ 9561-094332 for several times and finally I spoke with Mrs. Mumtaz in the last week of November, 2014. She agreed to send me the full and final receipt of the amt, yet it did not get delivered.  Thereafter, on 24-July-2015, I called up Mr. Shivam (Customer care), he also agreed to send full and final receipt. It doesn't seem to be happening since long.  Mr Ajay Bodke (Service & Quality Dept, Kanjur Marg), he gave me this e-mail address to follow-up.  I will do legal procedures, if I did not get full and final payment receipt acknowledgement from your end at the earliest.  Regards, Ajay Kothare|2015-09-15T07:42:55+0000

The worst experience with HDFC. I applied for a credit card on August 13, 2015. After 2 verification my Credit card dispatched to my home address on Sept 2. HDFC has updated my wrong phone no due to which I am unable to use my Credit card. I called the customer service, they told me that it will take 7-10 working days to rectify your problem. Today (Sept 15) I got a call from HDFC stating that the problem has been rectified and again it will take 10-15 days to generate my OTP to my new number so as to use my Credit Card. This is really very disgusting waiting for a month to just update my number and to receive a password though it was wrongly updated by HDFC backend. I wish I had not canceled my Citibank credit card. Atleast citibank has the best service in India.|2015-09-15T07:07:16+0000

Why does my HDFC Bank of Santhome Branch, Chennai not issuing Account Pass Book even after giving formal request letter? The officials there claiming, As per the higher officials order, We Can't provide Pass Book to the account holder and can only give away Account Statements in sheets.  Why it is so? Aren't there RBI Guidelines to all banks must issue pass books to customers on request?  Inspite of the GO from the Govt of India, MEA on allowing photo passbooks of private banks which enlists the name of HDFC Bank, as address proof for Passport application, the Bank employees, their customer care operators are totally unaware of this and refuse to issue any for salary accounts. According to RBI /2006-07/139, DBOD.No.Leg.BC.32 /09.07.005/2006-07 Banks are liable to provide photo passbooks to all the savings account holders. Nationalised banks proved to be far better. They should be penalised for harassing the customers for not following the RBI norms.|2015-09-15T06:28:52+0000

Hello, I am a customer of your bank, holding savings account (salaried). Two days back my account is showing debit of Rs.13,202/- (Holding Funds) and got to know that HDFC collections team has done this. I am shocked and not able to understand how can a bank debit any amount from customer's account without consent and approval. If I am holding all savings in my account it means the bank can hold even lakhs of rupees without even intimating to the Customer. Appreciate if a strict action be taken else there are other channels available to get this sorted out. Available on +91-9811011792. Regards Jasvinder Singh|2015-09-15T06:05:01+0000

Hello, I applied a credit card last month, HDFC asked me to submit documents. After that, I got a call for verification etc finally I got a call saying that your verification has been done and your credit limit will be 60k and you will get your Card within next week. I was waiting for the card and when I checked the status of the card it said DISAPPROVED because HDFC representative was unable to contact me it seems. After verifying everything it got disapproved. Than I called HDFC customer care and they said I need to send letter with Bank statement as office address proof, Rental Agreement and driving Licence as Residential address proof, PAN card, Office ID Card through DTDC. I got mail from Deepa that wait for 1 week. After that I noticed that my credit card status is again IN-PROCESS. I was happy.  Again I got call from HDFC for verification. They verifed my address everything and now that status is again Disapproved due to some financial stability something.  Why you guys ask people to do all this shit when you know that you're not gonna give anything. You would have tell this before. Why you're not ready to give the card I dont know. My Salary account is with HDFC. I'm having one existing Kotak Mahindra Bank credit card and I'm paying the bill from HDFC salary account but still you guys are not ready.  I'm thinking to close the HDFC salary account and switch the salary account with my existing Kotak Bank account.

Why you guys ask people to do all this shit when you know that you're not gonna give anything. You would have tell this before. Why you're not ready to give the card I dont know. My Salary account is with HDFC. I'm having one existing Kotak Mahindra Bank credit card and I'm paying the bill from HDFC salary account but still you guys are not ready.  I'm thinking to close the HDFC salary account and switch the salary account with my existing Kotak Bank account.

Hello, I applied a credit card last month, HDFC asked me to submit documents. After that, I got a call for verification etc finally I got a call saying that your verification has been done and your credit limit will be 60k and you will get your Card within next week. I was waiting for the card and when I checked the status of the card it said DISAPPROVED because HDFC representative was unable to contact me it seems. After verifying everything it got disapproved. Than I called HDFC customer care and they said I need to send letter with Bank statement as office address proof, Rental Agreement and driving Licence as Residential address proof, PAN card, Office ID Card through DTDC. I got mail from Deepa that wait for 1 week. After that I noticed that my credit card status is again IN-PROCESS. I was happy.  Again I got call from HDFC for verification. They verifed my address everything and now that status is again Disapproved due to some financial stability something.  Why you guys ask people to do all this shit when you know that you're not gonna give anything. You would have tell this before. Why you're not ready to give the card I dont know. My Salary account is with HDFC. I'm having one existing Kotak Mahindra Bank credit card and I'm paying the bill from HDFC salary account but still you guys are not ready.

Wow Awesome ATM FROM HDFC BANK IN FRAZER TOWN BRANCH   REALLY VERY GOOD SERVICE   Please don't only earn & establish but Maintain the standards|2015-09-14T07:40:08+0000
I cannot wait another 10 days for this to be resolved (complaints addressal takes between 10-30 days as per your website) and hence posting my 'complaints' here. Very disappointed and finally fed up with HDFC service and have lost faith in the staff at HDFC Bank Vasco Branch!  1) Both me and my husband are NRI customers of HDFC Bank, Vasco Branch, Goa. My husband applied for a second debit card (joint account) in July and received this WITHOUT a pin. He was told he will receive the pin by 'SMS'. Since when do banks send Debit card pins by SMS? We waited 3 days but did not receive this and finally on the 4th day HDFC officer confirms my husband's mobile number wasnt even registered (inspite of me asking him to check this on the first day itself!) Then we were asked to generate the pin online via netbanking! But since his netbanking facility wasn't yet activated this was not a possible solution. This was very inconvenient as we were out of state and were unable to use the card! When we got back (a week later) and argued the branch finally  called us to collect the pin in 30 minutes of us complaining saying they just received it. But the date on the envelope when we checked was the same date as the card was received. WHY was the pin WITHELD and so much INCONVENIENCE caused?  Again after this I requested for a new debit card with "chip" to replace my old one. And again when the card was received the branch did NOT give the pin but instead asked to generate it online. WHY? There is a CHARGE to RE-GENERATE the pin. We regenerate a pin only if it's forgotten which in this case it wasn't. When I asked the branch manager and pointed to her the above she quickly replied they will courier the pin! I have called/messaged her several times until now and its been over 3 weeks that we are awaiting the arrival of the pin! Is this some new scheme of HDFC to trick customers into spending unnecessarily to regenerate PINS?  2) After repeated requests from HDFC, we finally purchased two HDFC Life Insurance policies in January which we were not really interested in. We informed HDFC at the time, that being NRI's, NOBODY resides at our residence and NOT to send any correspondence there. We were told verbally this would be sent to our overseas address. However, my husband's policy booklet was delivered to our neighbors, which thankfully we obtained from them. However TILL DATE I HAVE NOT received my policy booklet/document. HDFC CLAIMS it was delivered but to WHOM? With whose permission are you delivering personal documents to neighbors? I need to receive a copy of my document ASAP and have already provided a different address in GOA where this may be sent along with address proof but its a month now and no action has been taken!|2015-09-14T07:17:55+0000

Hello Mrunal,   I went to market on 12th Sep'15 to withdraw money from ATM to buy medicines for my ailing mother, to my disappointment I found that my account balance is in negative and my funds has been put on hold.   Hence I was unable to withdraw money from HDFC bank ATM, it is clear cut case of deficiency in service. It happened when if was informed and confirmed to me by HDFC fraud department that I (Harshwardhan) has no role to play with loan (no. 32172031) and there will be no further communication from the HDFC Bank with respect to this loan.   I would really be surprised that you will come up with an excuse to justify that why it happened.   As per the legal advice given to me by my lawyer I wish to know how would you plan to compensate for the metal harassment caused by the careless attitude and deficiency in service on your part.   This fraud loan has affected my CIBIL score, so it is has to be corrected by HDFC bank only.|2015-09-13T18:50:05+0000

I have an account with hdfc bank a 15 year old account im working with a private firm and have a salary account with HDFC since past 3 months your bank/affiliate/partners have been taking my documents assuring me or in clear words promising me that I will be given a credit card from your bank, even after I informing them that the card will be rejected as I had settled an HDFC card earlier i have been promised saying that we take your documents just because we can provide you a credit card, I have been cheated thrice or I have a feeling that my documents are been misused in simple words just to complete the application targets or from some other misuse documents are been taken, I have a clear status in HDFC and im ashamed to deal with a bank like you now.  You can contact me on szabira@gmail.com and I need a complete explanation of is to why this is happening and need a compensation for the same, This will be taken to consumer forums/court and other social media websites if this will be unaddressed.

HDFC has the most pathetic service when I compare with the other banks like ICICI, SBI and SBT where I have an account.  I joined my new firm on 17th Aug'15 and an executive from HDFC (Mr. Someshekar - 9901820306) had come to my office to complete my bank related formalities. He said my account will be active in a week and along with the other bank related papers I got my debit card. The debit card was in a pathetic condition with half the number on it erased. When confronted him he said, I could apply for a fresh card online post my account is active and I would receive an intimation through mail regarding the activation. I spoke to him on 29th Aug again stating that I have registered to my net banking and unable to apply for a fresh debit card, to which he says the account hasn't been active and assured it would be soon. I was concerned if I would have my salary credited on 31st Aug. He said the salary would get credited even if the account is not active. I got my salary on 31st and I when I tried to withdraw I realized that the debit card wasn't functional. I called him again and he said the debit card would be functional in 2 days when on 17th aug he had assured it would take only 6 days. Please note the internet banking wasn't still working.  I waited till 5th September and realized that my account wasn't active still. I spoke to Mr. Nitesh - 9379463419 who is the manager of Mr. Someshekar on 5th Sep who assured me that my account will get active the same day or latest by Monday, 7th Sep. But till 9th Sep the account wasn't active.   Then I wrote to the customer support on 9th Sep where Mr. Prakash Sakhat told me that my account was active. I checked my account on the same day and realized my mobile number isnt updated, neither is my email ID. When I logged in the account today, 13th Sep again it doesn't display my name rather some number as it had been on 29th Aug. Tried doing third party transfer and got an error stating my mobile number isn't registered. So I realize my account isn't active yet  I have tried all means to get my account active and realized HDFC is the worst banker I could deal with.|2015-09-13T03:56:15+0000
Worst Bank in world. I already told thousand times to close my account and they are charging me AMD charges to open it. I am not using my account from last two years but they have opened it. When I go to close the account, they tell me to pay the charges.  Really pathetic service and worst bank.   Nishant 8860436727|2015-09-12T19:01:22+0000
HDFC sending OTP's for amount 1440.41 as 144041 (No currency symbol) and RS 210.54 as $210.54. Banking systems prevalent to Production issues. Very weak and vulnerable systems prone to hackers. Issued my second credit card from them after facing frauds of about 7000 inr (Thanks u understood and refunded me) from the first one, blocked this also immediately after receiving OTP in $ for INR transactions. Bye bye HDFC will close the credit card account now. Can't gain confidence in your bank now ever!!!!|2015-09-12T17:07:06+0000

Hey HDFC Bankcustomer services. I have been trying to contact your relationship manager for the past 3 days. He has not been replying to my emails and his phone is not reachable. Moreover, your helpline number 022-67606161 is not working properly. I am quite surprised with the response you guys have.

Dear HDFC bank, You advertised and sent mail stating that on 2nd and 4th Saturdays the bank branches will be closed. Welcome move thanks to RBI. However, I saw no message stating that you are withdrawing cheque drop facilities at the ATMs. So now if I have a cheque to drop over the weekend, I would need to wait for the 1st and 3rd Saturdays of the month since I cannot avail banking services in weekdays. Not a welcome move at all and most importantly why no information shared before stopping a service. Did I miss something?|2015-09-12T07:26:31+0000

Called again asked for supervisor 6 times nobody transfered the call and disconnected the call again. I again called the third time they said we are transfering your call to the correct department and the man who picked that call again disconnected my call. 3 disconnections in a row and you guys claimed that you have best banking facilities.

I'm really surprised that you have become the India's most valuable brand. Your service are pathetic. I went to sector 18 branch in Noida for the closure of my HDFC sec a/c and did all the formalities but today I have again been charged Rs 855 for demat which i thought got closed but apparently it hasn't and when I called HDFC bank then hdfc demat and were transferred to so many departments the result was ZERO. So i went to the branch to get this sorted and they were reluctant at first but eventually they gave some form and told me it will get sorted in 15 days but i had to pay for your ignorant employee. I bank with HDFC including car loan, credit card and I also wanted to invest in ELSS today but probably ULIPs are more profitable he kept on insisting me to invest in it and tried to mis-sold the plan. HDFC Sucks!|2015-09-11T12:50:51+0000

Painful experience dealing with HDFC Credit Card, to take a duplicate statement it takes more than 15 days. I requested for 5 months, they sent for 2 months only and close the service request, when asked call center they say its a mistake but you cannot complaint anywhere, really? then it takes another 48 hours to get the re-requested statement + 48 hours to receive email which has left HDFC servers, wow I think Speed Post is faster than this. Every time I call to know the status - call center says its under process or some senior will call but it never happens - when I express my urgency and displeasure and ask if any senior can talk - after 5 mins pause - same call attended says senior cannot talk and repeating same sentences and Guess what while you holding the line the caller tune says HDFC is awarded best bank for 3 yrs is row. seriously? where you can't complaint for mistakes done by call center, so called seniors in call center do not want to talk to the customer, you are waiting for ages to receive simple statement then how this bank can be best bank.|2015-09-11T10:10:54+0000

Hi Sir,  My name is Bikki Brahma, I am a credit card holder of your bank and recently applied for personal loan(Reference number 35000109). I got the confirmation of approval and on 7th Sep one concerned person came for physical verification who submitted a manipulated report and a wrong report. I even hold a credit card of HDFC and verification has been done at my residence with no consequences what so ever. The verification person on asking told me that he is the one one whose approval my loan would get approved and was arrogant enough who proved it by submitting a manipulated report and put my Loan on hold. I want a clarification on the same. And I hope the higher authorities are going to help me on the same. I stay on a rented house for almost an year and have all the basic amenities required like refrigerator sofa and my rented flat is 1bhk, which is enough for a single person. I don't know where I lacked. I am a bachelor and I don't think for securing loan I need to get married or I need to purchase a house. I hope to get a soon reply and my loan. When the physical verification of credit card was positive at the same location how it went negative for personal loan. Was I required to bribe the verification agent when he meant that on his approval loan will get approved. I hope to get a soon reply and my loan.  Thanking you. Bikki Brahma.|2015-09-11T08:40:15+0000

If you have a credit card with HDFC Bank along with Savings/Fixed Deposit or any other account with HDFC, you are advised to immediately close either your credit card account or the rest. Chances are they will link your deposits with the credit card for every other dispute on charges etc. Ultimately all your money will be eaten up by the greedy promoters of HDFC Bank.|2015-09-10T17:21:20+0000

Hi I am writing post is to inform you guys that the work culture of Hdfc Bank is worst. There is no proper timing of work. You guys call your employees 8 am in the morning and leave them 9:30 pm. Are you guys paying them for working 13 hours?? Even the female employees are working this late.  Every person have their own personal life but i don't think so that anyone in HDFC have so called personal life because of their work culture and timings. If your employees are not opposing you guys or the way you are treating them that doesn't mean that you'll take advantage of their dedication. This is one of the major reason of your high retention rate. Please note that your employees do have personal life and let them live that too.   #HDFC_Bank #DLF_1 #Gurgaon   Regards A concern Family/ Friend|2015-09-10T15:12:10+0000
Is it ethically correct that you first accept all the notes deposited at the cash counter which was both machine checked by me and also at the cash counter by your representative, and later debit Rs. 500/- from my account saying that 1 note is fake?  A customer puts a faith in a bank thinking that his money is in safe hands but what HDFC did to me has made me really re-think the faith that i have put in your bank.|2015-09-10T15:02:45+0000
Recently there was an issue on 30th Aug 2015 at 10:08am wherein I tried to withdraw Rs 2500 from ATM and the money came out for few seconds and before I could grab it the money went back inside  and I was not able to take it. Money was out only for a fraction of a second.   This is how HDFC is dealing with their customer's.   I went to HDFC ATM and there were 2 HDFC ATMs and like most of the time both the machines were faulty and was not dispensing out money. So I next went to the nearby Kotak ATM and tried to take money from there and it is here the incident happened wherein money came out for few seconds and again went back in before I could grab hold of it. There was a guard also available there and he asked me to contact the bank and said that normally in these cases money is credited back after sometime. The ATM slip which came out post that also gave an error saying “ Transaction Declined – 0070 - Hardware Error “. I then had to go to a 3rd nearby ATM of Standard Chartered and take out the money. I then called HDFC on 30th Aug 2015 itself and the person asked me to wait for 7 working days for the money to be credited. I again called in between after few days and was asked to wait till 8th Sep. Then finally I was called on 8th Sep and was informed that HDFC cannot do anything and I will be provided a dispute form and I had to raise and FIR from a police station as the issue was from Kotak ATM ( 3rd Party ).   Then again I called on 9th Sep as I did not get the dispute letter to which I was told that it cannot be sent on email and I had to go to nearest branch and collect dispute letter physically and then walk up to nearest police station to lodge and FIR and then go to Kotak and get the issue checked ( CCTV, etc etc ).   Had the 2 HDFC ATMs been working properly then why would there be a need for me to walk up to Kotak and Standard Chartered ATMs which are 7-10 steps away from HDFC ATM.  I fail to understand that I being a HDFC customer why should I myself do all the things and that too when I am not at fault ( go to HDFC bank – collect dispute letter – go to police station - lodge FIR – go to Kotak bank – get the CCTV checked and more things to follow post that ).   Do you think that this is correct and that too when it is not my fault ?  What is HDFC doing for us ?  And this is not the first time when I am facing problems with HDFC.  I also have many of my colleagues and friends who have account with HDFC and they are also not happy with HDFC due to some or the other issue.  I am very strongly thinking of leaving HDFC and moving my account to some other bank ( Kotak or ICICI most probably ).  Please share it as public awareness. HDFC is not customer centric moreover does not support the customer.|2015-09-10T13:58:25+0000
I applied for HDFC Credit Card and got Reference No : 15090812505910E1. I got all verification done at my office and residence too. I got multiple calls at office too for verification.  Today got checked in HDFC Link showing track your card application. Found the reason as follows.  Application Reference Number  15090812505910E1 Status- DISAPPROVED  Remarks- DISAPPROVAL OF THE CREDIT CARD APPLICATION DOES NOT REFLECT IN ANYWAY ON YOUR CREDIT STANDING OR YOUR FINANCIAL STABILITY  I given all papers and verification also done positively.I want Reason for Rejection.  From previous days I was very satisfied by HDFC bank and yours services.I Recommend all to go for HDFC.But today HDFC disappointing me so much, because if your bank don't want to give me the credit card, that's fine.I can't force HDFC. But please tell me the exact reason, then I rectified the issues and can apply correctly on future.  Please provide reason ASAP.|2015-09-10T10:12:32+0000

Total Time till now i spend on call is more then 100mins..What a great serivce by HDFC.|2015-09-10T07:37:58+0000
The most incompetent bank I have come across. We understand your world.! My footttt.... No value for customer's time, I asked my dad to deposit money in my account, they did not accept & rather asked him to go to branch where the account was open. What fuc*#g logic does it make, what generation bank is it, its asking either account holder should deposit or depositor should go to parent bank. Aftet doing night shift I have to get up & deposit the money in the bank. When asked why is money can't be deposited by any other person in my account,  the answer I got is 'this is the procedure sir' (Never seen or heard Non Sense like this..)  I had no interest in arguing with anyone at the bank. Instead I chose to post it on social media.  Even the ATM machines are from 2000-2002 generation where the card is still taken in by the machine, nowadays even govt banks ATM have dip card facility why not HDFC..  I don't use HDFC debit card since last time it was taken by the machine as I forgot to collect my card after transaction as I was in hurry. I checked with the bank very next day, they said ask the ATM attendant outside the bank, when I did they said no card found must be with machine,  I informed the same to the branch employee, for which he stated if we get your card will let you know. After 2 weeks I get a letter from HDFC stating we got your card in ATM as no claim from your end we have destroyed the card, please apply for a new card. I was like whyyyyyyyyyyy.... Instead you could have sent the card to my billing address. Its a shame & you guys are tarnishing your image.  Learn from ICICI BANK or the new new entrants like Axis Bank on how to do Customer Service for private sector banks.  Just hope u understand the criticality & help other customers serve better.  I am writing this post after I came back from bank, no sleep, if u understand my world please understand the level of my frustration.|2015-09-10T06:19:12+0000

I wonder inspite of most callous service and attitude of its team members, HDFC is regarded as top private bank. Is it arrogance of "TOP" or to reach the top one has to be callous or those who reach top become callous. if latter, then the ramp to bottom may be steeper than the HDFC team can imagine.|2015-09-10T03:22:56+0000

I have an issue: I have a bank account (Sector 11, Panchkula Branch). I got a letter from bank two weeks back signed by some one Mr Kashyap that as you have two IDs kindly close one account. If we will not hear anything from your end we will take necessary action as per RBI Guidelines  after September 10, 2015. I tried talking to the manager of the branch but he was not ready to give me solution to the problem and moreover insisted that you may close the account. On September 6, bank changed my name without informing me and without taking my permission. I submitted a complaint and today i got a call from the Bank Manager. But again he was sounding "Not Ready To Help or clarify the situation"  simply said that Central Authorities have changed what can we do?? Now my concern: Are they there to help, guide and support the customers. I have relation with the bank from last one decade, Do bank value that or it is just a small thing that if one customer is going let him go?? What was the purpose of today's call?? were they trying to scare me that why I submitted a complaint or raised the voice?? Am i actually dealing with one of the best bank??

Hi....I have an account with your Gopinath Delhi branch. 3 months ago I had deposited a check (at HDFC Channi Himmat, Jammu)  given my father of ICICI bank in to my HDFC account. For some reason my account number on the deposit slip was not entered correct ly...but all other details were there and were correct. I have been running pillar to Post and so had been my dad to get that amount reverted to my account...but somehow no one from your bank has cared to come forward with a solution... My father's bank manager had forwarded communication to your bank regarding this case..he repeatedly forwarded requests from my father to deposit the amount into my account...but nothing has happened yet. I have tried calling my personal banker many time s...can never seem to speak with her for some reason..I live in Jammu now. Every month one call I receive from your bank asking about my experience and each time I tell them of this case with a request to expedite the process... But there seems to be no result...I have say here that I am deeply anguished by your attitude... It seems like I have been taken for granted...I request someone in a responsible position to revert to this post or I my last resort will be filing a consumer complaint...|2015-09-09T10:01:52+0000

This is how Hdfc bank deals with customers and give only fake assurance. I am Hdfc bank classic banking customer. From June 2015 I am requesting you for credit card, and there is more than 15 email communications. In every email you provided assurance that our executive will contact you soon and will proceed credit card application. But its more then 3 months passed none of your executive support provided. It's better to withdraw from classic banking, and open a new account in Kotak bank at least they give 6% interest on saving account, so get better interest at least on minimum average balance|2015-09-09T05:05:10+0000

Hi My name is Gurdeep Singh, I have an account of HDFC sector 8 Chandigarh. I have applied Credit Card few days ago, and I was told that this credit card will be free of cost for life time and I will get 5% cash back for each swipe or online purchases etc. But when I received the  credit card, it was Jet Previlage card, and there is no cash back. HDFC executive made false commitment to me for applying credit card, when they came again to my office then I asked about where is the 5% cashback then they told me that this is Jet Privelage card and there is no cash back, then I told him that you have applied by saying 5% cash, I have no knowledge which card gives 5% cash back. Then they told me that I have to call customer care to upgrade this card to money back card, when I asked from phone bankers they told me they cant upgrade card on phone, you have to visit HDFC bank branch. I am totally fed up with the service of HDFC. Why I will go to the bank for correct the mistake that HDFC executives made for my credit card.   What services you are providing to the customers, I am really unhappy with these all.  I want my credit card to be upgraded with 5% cash back.  Waiting for fast response.

hi i am srikkanth  operating a current a/c in the name of Raghav Enterprises. My A/c was with SDA Branch Delhi and since 2 Months i got it transwered to Raopura Baroda Branch. Since My house was under construction in Delhi , i use to collect Cheque book Personally. Here also in Baroda i collect it personally from Branch. 2 Months back i applied for a Cheque book and by oversight the bank staff did not mention about the details in the form that it should be sent to baroda branch.  this cheque book went to my delhi address and went un delivered as it was under construction . raopura branch requested the chennai section atleast 7 to 8 times to send the cheque to their branch. but in spite of my several visit to the branch the matter has not been sorted out. their reply is what we can do . being in business with out cheque book is night mare, i am managing through net banking  and where ever i have to give PDC i am giving cash. i am helpless, i feel HDFC should stop flouting these awards , but simply address customer isuues with respect and the bank will grow automatically.  hope the issue will be addressed and in this e-age matter can be sorted out in no time, provided there is a positive attitude and will is there.   regards srikkanth|2015-09-08T03:23:47+0000

@Paresh Sukthankar - Deputy Managing Director. Many thanks for your letter informing me about your bank winning the Best Asian Bank Award. Congratulations.  But why is your email management so archaic. My company (StoryWorks) has an account in your bank and surely you have the record about who the people behind the account are.  So why would your email start with 'Dear Storyworks' ? If your mail managers are too lazy to pick up the names behind the company then I suggest you just go with 'Hi' or 'Hello'.|2015-09-08T02:06:48+0000

HDFC just doesn't care a about customers. Unfortunately i realize this after being loyal to them for more than a decade!  When my card was recently getting renewed I had specifically requested for a chip & pin credit card to avoid any misuse of my card. It worked fine for a few days and then suddenly decided to stop asking for a pin.  I called their customer care and they are trying to tell me that this card will randomly ask for pin, i.e. sometimes it will ask and sometimes it will not ask. They also went on to say that it depends on the type of machine the card is swiped in.   When I escalated (mailed) to their management their management (Managingdirector@hdfcbank.com) i get a response saying that they will take 5 business to revert to me!!!  this is the level of importance they give to sensitive issues like this!!! What if my card is misused in this duration who will be responsible?|2015-09-07T14:41:45+0000
3 weeks back I tried to withdraw Rs. 10000/- from a medieval era machine installed at HDFC ATM at City Court, Sikandarpur, Gurgaon. Money didn't dispense but my account got debited by Rs. 10000/-, which has not reversed till date. It happened with me many times before with my other bank ATM cards but transaction reversed within 24 hours. But with HDFC it hasn't happened even 3 weeks have passed. I have registered a complained  at customer care as well. Instead of putting my money back into account I received a call from some ATM representative asking me why I have not registered the complaint at the same time of incidence. I said I never had distrust on HDFC bank based on my experience but I now I think I was wrong, my trust has been breached. Hope you understand what it means when customers lose trust in a business particularly in a Bank. You charge heavily when a customer's cheque is dishonored due to any reason but you are not liable to pay anything when customers not able to withdraw their own money from your rickety ATMs for hundreds reason ranging from power failures to machine running out of money. You have an unfair advantage over your customers. I am gonna take it up to RBI and will make sure that we the customers don't pay and suffer for your inefficiencies.|2015-09-07T14:05:54+0000

what is AMB CHRG INCL ST & CESS .why you guys are deducting money from my a/c every time in the name AMB CHRG INCL ST & CESS.For every small transaction. HDFC sends a sms on mobile and even e-mails mentioning details. When it comes to hidden activities, there is no intimation to the customer ? Why i have not received a single mail or sms for these transactions. this rediculous just to maintain the average bal you ppl deduct the amount without any intimation . when it is a salary why should maintain the AVG bal or not thats up to me.|2015-09-07T09:10:44+0000

The kolkata number 03361606161 doesn't get connected to any one..when it says that it is connecting me to your representative ,it gets auto disconnected. I do not understand what kind of a pathetic customer service is this ?? And person if I am being illogical, but fail to understand why a brand name like HDFC in banking sector, can't afford a toll free number of its own for its users.. If this is the way you give support to your customers..then may almighty help you growing business in Indian market in near future.  Regards, One of your unsatisfied customer|2015-09-07T08:47:42+0000

Your phone banking customer service totally crappy!!! I got a new Debit card issued (I did not request for one, the bank just decided to send one on their own... that is a different issue all together!!).. there were some msgs sent to me giving a pin number which I had to use on the ATM to generate my pin, by the time I went to the ATM, the pin sent by the bank got de-activated. Now am left with a new debit card without a pin and the phone banking totally sucks bec there is just no option to talk to a customer care executive. I don't  have a phone banking pin nor a debit pin.....I have been trying since the past 2 days but TOTALLY FRUSTRATED!!!|2015-09-07T07:26:53+0000
I joined EY and submitted the account opening documents to the concerned corporate salary team on 4th August,2015. Still my account is not opened.

This is an example of pathetic customer service at HDFC.|2015-09-07T06:32:19+0000
HDFC has become a devil in my life, i am approaching towards closin down my three accounts if my request is not entertained. My loan got rejected by your employee on 17th august, since then i am asking for the documents to be returned.  Till today he was either bluffing me with different excuses or he ddnt use to pic the phone, when i complained of him in the showroom today, he said that i wont come, you have to collect the documents,  I promise to shut my accounts with HDFC before going to collect documents. Get me my documents as soon as possible. The bluffmaster employee AKASH #9999141318 Gurgaon  I request HDFC concerned athority to get me my documents instead of asking for further details, i have provided your employee name and mobile number, and the loan query was with name of SAMIR CHAWLA #9810234345|2015-09-07T06:30:57+0000
Am a HDFC Bank customer for more than 17 years. I fully appreciate the technology adoption by the bank which is a major attraction for someone like me. You have close to 100 functions which can be achieved thru netbanking. But I am surprised at the exclusion of  one key feature of scheduling recurring 3rd party fund transfer thru NEFT. This feature is offered by almost all other leading banks. I have shared this feedback thru other channels, still I am waiting for this feature to be included|2015-09-07T04:00:24+0000
I called phone banking to make some very URGENT changes to the debit instructions, after a wait on IVR I finally made it to Customer Service Rep...surprisingly none of my requests were honored and he said ' all that he can do is give information' and cannot actually do anything on my account. I thought I Called HDFC Phone BANKING?? Unfortunately something went wrong with my phone and lost my RMs number, when asked for the same which was just an information - he said he did not have it ---> guys neither was there any BANKING (so please rename as Customer Info Cell or something with a * mark so that people know its conditional) and nor any info on my RM --> isn't this pathetic?!?!  I had a similar thing to be done at Citi, yes I did have a wait on IVR after getting connected too many verifications and then the very URGENT changes to the debit instructiin were done in like 6 seconds and the 9th second I received an email confirmation too.|2015-09-06T16:26:07+0000
HDFC is making banking life miserable in previous two experience. Holding NRE and NRO account from past 8 years and minimum balance of more the required in past one year, they are not providing me DD on imperial account. Just to upgrade my account to Imperial account, Manager and relationship managers are making me run between J P Naraga and Jayanagar branch.   I never expected bank like HDFC will work as any public sector.  No one is ready to resolve issues, They wish to transfer on one another.   My holiday is just wasting in meeting branch manager and Relation ship manager to listen their policy and procedure which are very tedious to customers.  Hope I will close my 8 year old NRE account in this week. I will insist others not to use HDFC.  Hope to see reaction from any HDFC official.|2015-09-06T13:07:38+0000

I was facing some problem using it, so i decided to call the customers service. Everytime i reach the place on IVR where I can talk to perrson they pickup my call and hung it up. This has happened not once not twice but 7 times within 2 days. How I'm suppose to talk to someone reagring my issue.|2015-09-06T11:52:42+0000

Pathetic Service ... It takes ages to update details ... the website says "Walk in to any branch" ... talk to customer care ... I think this bank should conduct a training and each service desk employee should be well versed ... The Mobile app says you can update your contact details ... when you try to do that ... it says contact 24 hrs customer care ... when you talk to customer care executive they say .... follow the process of sending in hard copies .... Savings bank account & Credit card show up in Netbanking ... but the address change and phone number update of two relationships with this bank would take ages .... Just comparing this with ICICI bank and Standard chartered ... they have much smoother process & verification... Thinking of closing accounts with HDFC bank.|2015-09-06T09:20:27+0000

Respected HDFC,  I am a HDFC credit card holder, One month back back I requested HDFC credit card collection agent for a payment settlement of the card. The detail was given to me only after along time of my request. One fine weekend started with a harassment call from collection agents of the card and I was harassed by their team very badly. I am very upset and disappointed with the services of HDFC..I was so much harassed and pressurized by the executive of HDFC Bank in last couple of months for payment.   Mostly In my absence, without my knowledge they visited to my home and threaten to  my family, One day I checked their ID cards but they are not from your bank. For this misbehaving and tress passing I registered a FIR for that person and mailed to RBI also  The numbers from where I got the calls is mentioned below. So this unfortunate thing should not happen to any one else again. Please, be careful about the situations like this. The numbers from which I got threatened is 9711956621 & 8588845125. I already registered the FIR compliant in near by police station.  This bank needs only money they really don't bother whatever their customers are facing in his life. For this I will share my feedback in press. I am not in condition to pay the amount because I am jobless and not medically fit.  I want to do the settlement on my pending amount. I got a approx a settlement amount of Rs. 28000, but its too much high for a jobless person. I checked my last bills my actual purchasing on credit card is not more than 18000 & rest is all your levy taxes. I am ready to pay this amount in EMI, I dont have an issue.  I am writing you this letter as I need to inform you of my present financial condition and the difficulties that I am experiencing. I am jobless from last four months.   I want to do settlement on Rs.18,000 on EMI basis. I can give you only this much amount.  My credit card no is:   5242 1610 0170 3021  I am requesting you to please provide me settlement letter of with NOC of Rs.18,000  I hope I will expect a call from your senior most manager of credit card department within in next 2 or 3 working days. Please know that I have appreciated the patience and professionalism that your staff has given in this process, and that this correspondence has been sent. I am sincerely obliged to you for your help and corporation.  SAURABH BANYAL +91-9810178910|2015-09-06T04:17:16+0000
Dear Sir/ Madam,  This is in reference to your letter dated 27.02.2015 for the position of Sales Officer in retail branch banking at Ghilor Kalan branch (3859), Ghilor Kalan. Kindly note that I had accepted the captioned offer of yours and joined the respective branch on 27.02.2015 and reported to Mr. Manish Jain. I would like to bring to your kind notice that I have worked with your bank from 27.02.2015 to 18.04.2015 and later on submitted my resignation as per your extant guidelines due to some personal circumstances.  I have requested Mr. Manish Jain, Branch head, Ghilor Kalan to acknowledge the receipt of my resignation letter but he bluntly denied to do the same and told me to go & take a legal action through court, if you want your acknowledgment.  . He treated me like a slave after submitting my resignation. He is a very rude person, when someone goes against his will. He considers he/ she as an enemy and do everything to ruin their career. Although he promised me that I will get my salary via full & final settlement process along with the relieving letter. But, till date neither I have received my salary for the period I have worked i.e. 27.02.2015 to 18.04.2015 and nor the relieving letter.  Please find below my other details : Name : PURUSHARATH SHARMA Employee No. : 140923 ACCOUNT NO. : 50100093874483 Bank & Branch : HDFC BANK LTD, GHILLOR KALAN Kindly arrange to issue relieving letter & full & final amount you owe to me through DD in favor of PURUSHARATH SHARMA.

Such an incompetency in business and utterly shattered customer services that I can ever exepect from a low ranking bank. I have written an email for almost a year and not even a single acknowlwdgement and if you try calling them from overseas then its next to nuisance. I thought it would be better but more than worst. If you have littee bit customer management skills left then do let me know here else i will be pulling out all my accounts from your bank.|2015-09-05T09:47:52+0000

@Hdfcbank every time I bank wid u, I face some nonsensical rules of yours either at the branch or net banking. Over and above, some of the staffs at your branches should be trained for customer service and your own rules!

This is regarding my complaints: HBL=030-847-487, HBL=030-847-494, HBL=030-847-510, HBL=030-854-213, #15205143225. The first complaint was raised on 24th July 2015. I was promised that I would get Rs.250 as cashback by the HDFC representative who came to collect the form, but was not reflected in any of my statements. After frequent follow-up’s I was told that I am not eligible for it and they asked for contact details of the person who collected the form which unfortunately I don't have it, and HDFC provided an excuse stating that only online applications are eligible for this offer. Secondly, I was promised that I am eligible for 5% cash back on certain category of transactions which also is not reflected in my statements from the beginning. I get calls from HDFC in this regards, some said I am eligible and others declined. Finally Mr. Manikandan, HDFC Manager, agreed that I am eligible for the cashback via email (earlier he declined the same while in a discussion on call) and the same is already credited to my card account. But I still can't find it. Only Rs.44.45 was credited as cash back in my account, the calculation for which HDFC customer care support team and your manager Mr. Manikandan failed to explain. Also, on my last call to customer care on 24th August 2015, the lady promised a call back from one of the Manager Mr. Chandrashkar but that didn’t happen too. Later, I sent an email to Mr. Binod P on 26th August and don’t know why, I am still hoping that I would get a response in spite of sending him reminders. Whenever I reply to the HDFC email, it takes a week for Mr. Manikandan to repeat the same words which he already wrote in his previous email rather than giving the exact reply to my questions and queries. A customer waits for a week just to get a stupid response? I am really annoyed with the type of service provided by HDFC. This is the kind of service I get after paying my bills on time? I have wasted hours on call with your support team and my money too.   Your unhappy customer, Ajay Patel 8197579305|2015-09-05T06:36:50+0000

Dear Hdfc team,  I just called customer care demat account department to enquire about the reimbursement charge for demat account  as I have closed it. The representative told me that only 75 percent of charges gets refund. When I told her that I wasn't informed about it and I was again mislead the wonderful reply was  " Sir aapke to itne aa gaye, bahut hai. Auro ke to itne bhi nahi aate. "  On being asked about complaint or reference no, she denied to give any. On being asked her name, she disconnected the call. This is the kind of replies and services your customers are getting. Wonderful. You surely have a long way to go.  Regards Aman arora  9650277555  nanakarora297@gmail.com|2015-09-05T05:10:26+0000

To, Ravi Bhardwaj, Master Card, Market Development, South Asia. In continuations of my earlier queries and communication with Mr. Pravin Khandelwal about the credit card application and approval process adopted by all the banks, please go through this once again and forward it to the concern authority of all the nationalized banks and help us to solve this long awaited problem.  In the last few years, I have noticed that all pvt.and some nationalised banks like HDFC, ICICI, AXIS, SBI and many more banks are rejecting fresh credit card applications by a self employed person or a businessman who declares his income in the annual ITR, which exceeds their specific requirements and criteria. What could possibly be the reason behind such a discriminatory behaviour?  Is there any specific reason to reject? Why are they processing and approving the applications received from a salaried person only? In many cases I have been asked to inquire and negotiate with the higher authorities of credit cards division but either they don't bother to reply or in some cases they simply reply that they cannot process it due to certain internal policies of the bank.  In terms of the instructions contained in the RBI.Master circular for issuing credit and debit card circular DBOD.No.Leg.BC.65/09.07.005/2006-07 dated March 6, 2007, banks have been advised that in case of all categories of loans irrespective of any threshold limits, including credit card applications, banks should convey in writing the main reason/reasons which in the opinion of the bank have led to the rejection of the loan applications. It is reiterated that banks should convey in writing the main reason/reasons which have led to the rejection of the credit card applications.  Are they really follow the guideline provided bythe Reserve bank of India for accepting and rejecting application? So if there are any more criterion that needs to fulfilled by the customer, why can't they specify it?  Also, while processing any kind of application are they liable in the event of anything going wrong?  Another question of signicficance is whether the CIBIL credit score is taken into consideration for the processing?  Please find out the correct reasons and policies with the Managing Directors and Chairman of all the private and natonalized banks. Also CEO of master cards should take initiative at earliest to help our CAIT members to procure credit card for online trading and purchase .   Regards, Ajay Modi.

Had a pathetic experience at HDFC bank Okhla phase 1 branch... 15 people waiting in the queue for deposit withdrawal. Only one counter active...and the queue becoming bigger every minute. The so called personal bankers sitting idle...can't they deploy more counters for people...front desk when they know that such can be the footfall...really pathetic service from a so called world class bank...i know this would never reach the HDFC CEO or top shots as they are sitting cozily...I wish at least private banks could change...|2015-09-04T10:08:24+0000
#HDFCBANK is #waste!!!! I've made multiple rtgs transactions with smaller amount through this bank & every time bank has charged me with 1000-2000rs; when I raised this issue to the concern person he suggested me to increase my limit, so I did, but the bank again charged me, I again raised this issue that even after raising my limit how can bank charge me with a such a big amount & the concerned person promised me that the charges will be reverted back in your account & kept on giving me false promises, it's been almost 8 months I'm waiting for money. Till now I have lost 7000-8000rs & have stopped doing transactions through #HDFCBANK due to the useless services of your bank, I've even tried writing to you but got zero response, I even tried your customer care no but the end result is #NOTHING. I want my money back.!!!!!|2015-09-04T10:03:53+0000

I am a customer holding a credit card of your bank. I have a serious complaint on the wrong information provided by your bank staff I had done for a client which had a auto renewal clause in it. I had specifically checked with your telle staff on 21st August 2015 on if I can stop the payment for any vendor I wish to, to which I was made to believe that its possible by either sending a letter to your Chennai address or through net banking, even so I was told that i can create a net bank acount specifically for the CC in case its not linked with any of my HDFC accounts.  To my shock, today while inquiring on some other aspect I casually checked the process again I was told by the tele exec that it cannot be done and its not possible (sounds illogical as I should have the right to my financial management)...  I would request you to please tell me which of the two versions are correct.. because one has to be wrong and I am so disturbed with the fact that you can provide any information and retract later on with the customer having no proof of what went on the call???|2015-09-04T08:51:00+0000
Another basic service - FAILURE !!!!!   On 24th Aug i opened Fixed Deposit online. While opening i checked the interest rates in the standard link given. It was showing as 8.5% for 1 year and 1 day. I did checked calling couple of times with 2 different HDFC call center exec (my experience in last 8 yrs is that no 2 execs are always consistent in proving response as a consulting one).. and understood the process of filling the form.. There is no FAQ or help section to show me a video on how to open a FD.. is it so complicated to have one ? it is Basics and improvement #1  After opening, i found in my certificate that the interest rate was applied as 8.2% (8.14 for monthly opt out) only. I reached customer care and the response was given repeatedly as "it is 8.2% only sir" again and again.. What a fantastic training ! keep it up..... and Kudos to that idiotic trainer..  In one of the cal, one of the executives told me that there is a relationship manager assigned to me.. I took his contact details from that executive.. (Name is Nirmal and his contact number is 9940238080).. is this contact detail is a secret ? Why not this info available in my online log in portfolio.. Basics and improvement #2  I discussed with Nirmal last Friday in this regard over the phone. He said he need 2 days time (not sure he reached to RBI to check any) and today 4th Sep (nearly 1 week), he came back and said this " Dear sir the FD was booked for 8.2% only and the revision was happened on July 2015.".. The basic question was never understood by anyone.. The question is "where can i see the ROI date change and the history online.. Why this is kept secret.. When homeloan is showing me ROI history why not FD ROI history ? its a shame.. When i deposited on 24th August, i saw the ROI as 8.5% and the ROI was updated later.. I am aware that the ROI is subjected to change anytime.. But why not HDFC mention the last ROI date change and also provide the historical ROI change with dates...  Basics and improvement #3  My details : I have my Salary account with HDFC, Credit card with HDFC, DMAT account with HDFC, Home loan with HDFC, FD with HDFC (recently)...   With these 1 week of hurdle i summarised the situation as PATHETIC and LOST CONFIDENCE with HDFC for 2 reasons.. (1) Cant provide these basic services and poor (annoying) customer service.. (2) Lost trust..|2015-09-04T07:59:36+0000
August month HDFC credit card statement was a mess.. I signed for online statement and i get emails each month to track and make sure enough funds are available in my HDFC bank account for ECS. This time they sent a letter. In this electronic world, HDFC promotes many new products, information through facebook and email. Why there was no early indication that they failed to generate a credit card statement. The online profile got a very good process called email (secured inbox), it is not used at all. There is no email communication stating as apologies on this instance..   Those olden days had gone.. these kind of HIDE n SEEK business games are useless.. when big companies like TOYOTA, are calling back their products due to failures.. what these BIG banks are going to do ?   Way to go.. to improve basic services and ethics.. come on guys.. don't fool your customers.. be proactive and very close with them for them to be loyal..|2015-09-04T07:41:40+0000

This morning I called again and was told the application form was not received. Now I have been asked to download the form and send it again!  Why is it that HDFC bank is making its so called premium customers make so many calls to get a simple thing done?  Is there a way to email the form? the downloaded form is so cumbersome to get printed on both sides and cut to shape for posting.  Or is there a simple form in word I can fill in and post?

HDFC one of the best banks .. Poor service .. You guys opened my Demat account without my consent and now you have charged me some amount for none reasons .. This is how you are building your business??? I want my demat account to be closed asap!|2015-09-03T04:47:02+0000
Why is that your Customer service has been making me regret every day that why did I end up taking an HDFC credit card? I already had an Axis bank credit card and was extremely happy with it until one of your sales official almost begged that I should take this card and assured that there will never be an unnecessary charge on this. I took this card and used it as and when necessary beyond my Axis bank credit card happily till this April.   I must regret to say that despite being such a reputed brand your Customer service is extremely PATHETIC to say the least. Every time I call them about my bill being inflated unnecessarily every month I dont get any response. They just say "Mam, you have to pay the bill". I had a very clear concern that I did not receive the bill of my last payment either through mail or post and as a special case I should be allowed to pay the exact amount and allowed to use the card.   1) Response by HDFC HITEC City Hyd branch - "Speak to Phone banking as we cant help 2) Response from Phone Banking - "Speak to HDFC Collections office at Begumpet, Hyderabad" 3) Response from Collections office - "Our people cant help you, Go and write to the Customer service email" 4) Customer Service  - Our people cant help you, go and call up Debt team" 5) Debt Team - No response as I have been trying to call up since last 2 days but no one picks up the call.   This is insane. My husband has been using HDFC account since long and thats why we have been using your services. We have written to your senior officials regarding this as well.   Can we expect someone to please look into this urgently?|2015-09-03T04:08:26+0000
I am Ashish Goyal having a savings account in HDFC Bank for Last 9-10 years. And for last 2 years I have been applying for the credit card, but the same is getting done. Even I have written a mail to Mr. Parag Rao & Aditya puri. But still there was no response. Also at last there is no one in the company who can share the reason for rejecting my credit card application. It was for the first time when any service industry is not sharing the reason for rejecting any application|2015-09-02T18:17:59+0000

For about an year now I've been getting bank statements for a Sejal Madhav Patankar. I am, in no way, associated or related to this person.  I've tried sending emails to HDFC, tried using your "opt out" links, but nothing has changed - I keep getting the bank statements and emails intended for her. I figured if I post something on a public site someone from HDFC would actually care enough to take some action.|2015-09-02T14:34:29+0000
Hi,  Your customer care service is the worst i have ever tried....!!! I got a SMS that a new card has been assigned to me and it will be activated soon. I tried to call your customer care to inform that i didn't got any new card...and waited for 30 minutes.But No one is picking the call.  Kindly check the issue....and cancel my credit card... I don't need your credit card,if you have such service.  Thanks, Chandan Saha|2015-09-02T13:56:34+0000
I am Rajesh Kumar a loyal customer but off -late i am in great stress because of the recent experience i went through HDFC home loan deptt, Munirka Branch. New Delhi. The bank is denying for further disbursal and the builder is after my life for the payment. My loan has been sanctioned and partly disbursed but now they are denying. I dont know why..failed to understand. I have been paying the EMIs without fail. I have so many transaction with the bank like i have 2 accounts, 1 car loan, 1personal loan and now the home loan. I mean i have not defaulted for not even a single time why HDFC is denying. The builder is making money, bank is making money but i am suffering. I wrote so many mails to Jitesh Arora, manager operations at Munirka but he does not bother to reply even.  I have finally decided to go to consumer court and seek justice as i am seeing my dream for home is shattering.|2015-09-02T11:16:41+0000

Dear HDFC,  Kindly let me know the Status for Loan Application No:- 616739182. I have received the acknowledgment of application on 28th August'15 and loan processing fee was debited  from my account on 29th August'15. My property registration for which I have applied the loan is due on 5th September'15. For that I have already paid the stamp duty & registration charges.

Its been a week I had registered a request for address updation through net banking. Have also followed the procedure and uploaded the relevant proof duly self attested but there is no response/ change in the details till date.  Also the customer care service is pathetic...executives themselves do not know what they are saying...when I called customer care(Complaint No.DELC0915013229), the solution they have given is to visit the branch for address change and that too will take 1 week to do so! I don't understand what for, is your online facility? Sheer waste of time and no solution...Poor customer service!|2015-09-02T07:51:20+0000

Its not about money, its just how big compnies are serving people. I have acct in ICICI and as i wanted money i went to withdraw money from HDFC atm near JP NAGAR 2nd phase Bangalore. As the machine takes the card inside, as soon I entered the amount of withdrawal power went off and there was no UPS no security or no1 to assist what needs to be done. For no mistake of mine I had to stand infront of that ATM machine till the power comes as i dint know what was their procedure. I dint receive the card. And when I went the next day, security was there and he told me i need to go to the bank for the card, when i called the bank they told me i ill have to fill a form with their CS and then after 5 working days i will be receiving the card. For their mistake why should I wait. And when they have the card i can provide the ID proof so why cant they return my card? I had to again go get a Instant card as it was emergency for me, where they charge for the card. So for no mistake of mine, I had to run behind this leaving my all works. The amount I spent may be not a big amount, but the procedure they are following is troubling ppl. As i have listen to similar problem with HDFC bank bfr aswell. Please resolve this issue. I dont want to pay for others mistake.|2015-09-02T07:38:30+0000

this is the worst bank in India with 3rd grade customer service, I should say, no grade actually. Their Multi Currency login portal is down since 22nd Aug 2015 and they just say, it would be up in 2 days, 3 days, and so on.   Now, their comment would be, please share Reference no for complain, which by the way I have shared 5-6 times, next thing that they would say is our representative will revert asap and work on priority, which they are doing from last 13-14 days. Last and not the least, HDFC has best fucking customer service, I don't know who gives this rating, instead of paying money for advertisement, if they work on their infrastructure and system maintenance, better system developers, they would lead.  And for info, before they repeat their template, my reference id is FB260815444 and 031-061-612.  So, HDFC Bank don't ask same question again, tell me by what date your shitty portal would be up??  Is is going to take a year, or probably next financial year??|2015-09-01T18:42:50+0000
I am an Imperia customer and I am very, very disappointed by my experience for the last 2 months with my credit card. Entirely unsolicited, you decided to upgrade my card to Regalia. Then you made my perfectly working Signature credit card invalid. You spent weeks confirming for me whether I would be charged annual fees. I have made it abundantly clear I won't pay a paisa as this is a choice you forced on me. And on top of it, the cards (for both me and for my wife) never worked! Now it's been 2 months but I haven't been able to make any transaction using the Regalia credit card - it does not work for both regular as well as online transactions. Just gets declined with different error messages that nobody at HDFC seems to know about. Every time various people make various promises, try different tricks like generating an OTP etc and nothing has worked so far. Meanwhile I'm doing all my transactions to another credit card - a move which I will soon make permanently. Why in the world did HDFC do this?|2015-09-01T17:14:12+0000
Hi, I would like to report a concern I have recently faced in Gurgaon Sec 31 branch. I sent a self cheque  for encashment by my friend. My friend, who went there with the cheque, was neither provided with the cash nor with the cheque. He was asked to get an id, which when shown, was not sufficient for the staff there. This incident took place on 25 Aug and yet despite several attempts (even on my personal part) did not take a bit to answer or reach back to the customer. Can you please look into this? And also arrange a call back with the manager, as the manager himself is not interested in any communication (even if there is one at any time). My cheque is still lying in the bank, with no action taken yet. If this happens with youngsters like me, I am unable to imagine how things would go with the elders in the bank. this has happened to females of my family as well.|2015-09-01T17:11:49+0000

Hi team ,  This is Rahul from Hyderabad,who is one of your new HDFC credit card holder. Its really peaty and frustrating that you people stopped working now a days . I received a credit card from you after one month of request and after receiving that bloody card i tried to activate using the OTP( one time password) and it says that my mobile number is invalid which was a shock for me. Later I called customers support, which was just waste of time and did not find any resolution, instead stated that there are N number of customers facing the same issue with the mobile series starting with 91XXXXXXXX. The Support was awful and the rep stated it would told take 1 day but when I spoke the Manager (Anil), he said it would take 4 days. This is not the first time I am facing the issue, really pissed off with the services. Even there is no tool free number for your services, which again is a big pain (charging 30-40 rupees per call).  Even I am not aware that the issue would be resolved or not.... But just to say, it was really bad experience on the first call on your service.  Hoping to you would rectify this problem as soon as possible, if you think you have really best support in India. ( My number - 916070405).|2015-09-01T14:31:23+0000

HDFC Bank, please learn something from ICICI Bank. You are far behind from ICICI Bank in all aspects either customer service, policies , business rules, online security.  In name of banking security your policies and services are pathetic and not at all customers friendly. I am hdfc customer since 2006 and tried all services like  online banking, credit card but sorry to tell you I got disappointed in all of hdfc services.|2015-09-01T04:40:04+0000
Negligence on the part of HDFC Bank: A cheque, no. 000124 dated 25-5-15, drawn on P&SB Con Cir ND-110001 Branch for Rs 69,801/-sent by us to HDFC for clearing was rejected by the drawee bank on 6-7-15, but not returned to us. We were searching for this Cheque in our office. When we did not find it, we wrote to our Branch at Masoodpur New Delhi-110070 on 26-8-15 to check if they had it. Surely enough, it was there and HDFC person handed over to us on 26-8-15. By this time the cheque's validity had expired and we could then do nothing to recover the cheque amount from the party issuing the cheque.   Due to bank's negligence, we have lost an amount of Rs 69,801/-.   We demand that HDFC Bank makes good our loss which has been caused by their negligence.|2015-09-01T03:00:41+0000

How more inconvenient does h d f c b a n k ' s netbanking password reset can get as it is right now??!!  I live abroad and don't have a debit card associated with my netbanking account. I called up customer care and they said they can not do any thing to help me reset my password and asked to me to EITHER visit a nearest branch (which I can not unless hdfcbank sponsor's me a trip to India) OR send an email to support@hdfcbank.com for further assistance.   I dropped an email with all the details I could put and the guys responses with the same thing as said by customer care, i.e. either visit a branch OR reset your pin online using debit card.  Now, kindly tell me how frustrating a password reset can get than this? What good are mobile number & email address when you can't even use them to reset the password.  Does the bank wants their customer to face all sort of inconvenient they could to just reset the password?? Additionally, what's the DEAL with charging roughly 50 INR for resetting the password had I been present in INDIA and happen to visit a branch to reset my password by submitting the form? Is resetting a password a great deal for your bank such that involves customers charging money for it?   Sincerely, Disappointed customer|2015-08-31T15:47:05+0000
When will you guys stop fooling customer. When will you improve your complaint department who responds to mail without any logic and without reading the content. How can you give false commitment. I had applied for a credit which was approved wherein got a confirmation from verification department. My Cibil score is 789 and having the bank account on same address for past 4 years wherein having a loan. Mr Puri this is the way you handle you customers i will be forced to take legal action now because enough is enough now. My number is 9768666610 and 9867806868.|2015-08-31T15:41:17+0000

I have waited for more than 1 month to get my salary account opened in HDFC bank, and in spite of submitting all my papers, and repeatedly following up , I'm told that the process is still on. In this time and age, you seems like very primitive bank. And the funny thing is that is is happening inspite of me having a joint account with my wife, hence i already have a customer id. The executive who is looking after my Mr. Jignesh 9702479979, who claims he is trying his best!|2015-08-31T09:58:36+0000

KIND ATTN:  This alert message is to all people. Please please please read.  I had recently got calls from some goons taking HDFC's name and torturing me and my husband over mobile phones and company's numbers and threatening me and our company by telling them false stories. These gangs always have ladies to call. When asked about any document or send your person, they dont do this. They only say that go to Kanjurmarg branch you will get all details. They don't have any information. They torture us so much by continuously calling on Company's number and use fowl languages and embarrass us  to a large extent. The way they talk its understood these ppl are not from any banks. One of my friends was also harassed  by same lady. They only say go to Kanjurmarg branch.  I and my husband had even gone to police and they talked with them. These goons are so much trained that they even told them stories about loans taken by us (which was never taken) and they had not paid. Police thinks that these are their internal matters and matter can be solved by doing any sort of settlement.This lady even called police and police said that its not their matter and you ppl see how it can be solved. The harassment calls continued.I am a very strong woman but the embarrassment caused by these calls to me in the company was very high that i used to cry. These ppl think that nobody will go to branch and verify. we had also sent a mail to HDFC bank for such dirty tactics used to extort money from innocent ppls.but no reply.  In morning of Rkshabandhan the calls started. Now this got on my nerves and thought to end it. I serached google for kanjurmarg brach number but the contacts were of no use. Phone lagte hi nahi. I called HDFC my branch and asked for contact number of Kanjurmarg branch as i was so fed up that i wanted to make an official complain about HDFC Kanjurmarg branch. The lady from my branch told me to complain to HDFC branch right now where i am at present. I with my husband had gone to the nearest bank and complained to the operational manager about the same. The manager had called on that number, hello speaking from HDFC, to my surprise the lady disconnected. He again called and this time a man picked the call. Manager asked him several questions that which is this agency, employ id, and code which were not answered by them. He even told them tu kisi andu pandu ke saath baat nahi kar raha u are talking with an HDFC employ and you are harrassing our customers and they are lodging an FIR with the Police and give to your manager the calls , the way the goons answered to him he knew these are not any HDFC bank ppl and they can make an FIR against them. I had lodged a compliant to HDFC about the incident and that we are lodging an FIR for it and taken stamp of the bank over the complaint.  Since these goons are not bank ppl our mails are not answered. We again gone to Police and lodged an FIR against them. Police now said you should have callled them at some place and we would have caught them. But these goons never send any person for any collection they call to Kanjurmarg for settlement they say Bank tumhare hisab se nahi chalegi. Police also had received one day back same nature of complaint and that was for ICICI.  My request to all people will be to share this message as much as possible as these gangs might be troubling some other peoples in same way.  Don't get scared at all. Go to nearest police station and lodge an FIR with them. This is a gang taking names of Banks and tell cases like in 2003, 2004 etc such thing had happend.   Please take help of police for setting a trap and let these gang get caught.They say dont use fowl language calls are recoreded. Koi calls record nahi hota he. They are very intelligent and have gorls for making calls.  Be aware and dont get frightened. There aim is to make you embarass and scare you. My calls have stopped now. But i wished she started and i would with police could have made a trap.  Please share this on your walls.|2015-08-31T06:13:13+0000
