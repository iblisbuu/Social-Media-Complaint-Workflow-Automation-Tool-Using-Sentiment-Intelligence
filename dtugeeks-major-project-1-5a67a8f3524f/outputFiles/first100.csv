Cheque was LOCAL HDFC cheque which must be cleared within same day day or next day, but it is not processed yet if processed then why the Bank has no status of same.  There are charges for every delayed or failure for customer why not for the bank.  Kindly check and update me the status of my cheque on priority basis.

Dear HDFC,  Please note that i applied for HDFC Credit Card on 06/10/2015 and got Reference No: 15100519293300S2. I got all verification done at my office.

Hi,  I am a user of your HDFC credit card from years and have generally been very satisfied with your level of services. For  current card 4617873001959284 I made a late payment for the month of August 2015 as I was shifting cities and had no access to internet for days. I contacted your customer team and on September 11 I received a reply from Kritika S. (Ref 15254373247) that these charges would be reversed in the October statement (Rs 500 + 411).  However to my utter surprise these charges were not showing reversed when my statement for the month of October was generated. I again contacted your customer care team and asked that when I was assured that these charges would be showing reversed in the October statement then why are they not showing so?  Twice I got the same reply from Murugan (Ref ID 15283184226 ) and Anthony (15285438285) that these charges would be reversed in the November statement. It seemed that a robot was answering to my emails without even reading my emails properly.  I have two questions for which I seek immediate answers from you  1) When I was assured that these charges will be reversed in the October statement by Kritika S on September 11 then why has the needful not been done? 2) Do you hire your customer care officials out of kindergarten. Who make spelling mistakes in emails (my name was spelt incorrectly in both emails) and cannot even comprehend basic emails? (reiterating that the charges would be reversed in the November statement instead of answering why were they not reversed in the October one as I was promised)  Abhishek Manroa 9873262673|2015-10-18T05:13:24+0000

HDFC replaced my credit card but not merged with my existing account so that i can't monitor my transactions at our NetBank credit card section after logged into my NetBank site. And importantly I can't received statements. I several times given rings i mean called c Care but they never answered me even after long waiting and my mobile battery drained. This is the reality of our customer care. Is it's caring or hurting can't i understood. You can see my repayments history that i never failed but at this month i failed due to lacked awarded i never received emails from HDFC I monitor online and I maintained always.

Hi HDFC Bank  I am experiencing the worst customer service for past 15 days. I made a transaction of 19k's on Amazon on 11th August and it was confirmed 15% cashback. Your reps for 3 times told me that it would be credited to me in Oct statement and when I called them today, they said it would be there in Nov statement. Why is so much ambiguity amongst your people? Why can not they share an exact information with the customer? This is making me think to move to some other back . Its pathetic customer service I must say.  Thanks|2015-10-17T15:20:33+0000

Very very bad customer Service by hdfc  1st.. Me & my brother went for bank account opening in a hdfc branch. & they ask for rs.35000 for account opening. Is it a policy of hdfc & also force to take RD policy.  2nd. Today i went to same branch of hdfc bank to transfer my other city account to my hometown. The person told me you hav to maintain rs.10,000 minimum balance in ur account. Which generally rs.5,000 for my hdfc bank account & for other bank accounts also. I said ok for the same. But the personal told me u also have to RD policy from our branch. I refused for the same. Then the personal is going rude & told me if you dont take RD policy i will not open your account in my branch. Im shocked from this scenario. Im operationg & in relation with hdfc over 6 years. But im going to end all relation with hdfc as of now. But i need answer from ur side if i dont want to take any of ur policy. Then your employee going to rude with customer & denied to open a account or transfer the account.|2015-10-17T10:03:44+0000

I am a resident of Pune & have processed my Term Insurance. I have received the confirmation email on the 24th Sept.  Application number - 1100008842872 Payment was made on the 8th Sept, 2015. Today I received a call from the HDFC agent stating that it is taking time for the Underwriters to take a decision. However he also confirmed that my medical tests are clear. What is the use of paying HDFC more than a month ago & the policy is not yet issued???? What is the logic of naming your organization CLICK2PROTECT??? If its taking so long to issue a simple policy?????? There was a lot of confusion during the medical tests also which was resolved by the agent. This email has been sent with specific attachment to managingdirector also. Dont know if this will work with kind of illiterate tele callers who keep calling.

Keeping in mind the festive season I applied for a HDFC credit card on 1st Sept 2015 but till date I have not received any kind of written confirmation from HDFC team. I mean such a great bank like HDFC is operating and treating their customer in such a unprofessional way. Till date I dont even know that whether all those personal and important details and documents of mine collected by the so called HDFC executive was used for a genuine purpose or not because I was left with an application number only (i.e. CC23058043) which never help me out in any ways. The so called HDFC executive (Mobile No: 8190883553) who used to call me 10 times a day before collecting and processing the document has stooped responding anymore even after providing him a new reference customer for credit card. It is such a disgusting thing that I have to wait for a credit card application to get processed for nearly 2 months. I understand that these things are very sensitive case and several verification has to be done but HDFC is so unprofessional that they cannot send a single mail or sms requesting a customer to wait and hire such people those who does't care to respond.   So I request you to at least let me know whether the guy who collected the documents were used for genuine purpose or not because now I dont want to have an HDFC credit card anymore.  Never expected such kind of service from HDFC and just because of your service my name got spoiled in my friend circle as I referred a friend of mine to apply for the same along with me and she is also still waiting for the same.  Thank you for the unexpected service from HDFC Bank and ruining my plans for this festive season.  Bikramjeet Bhattacharjee  Bikram_89@yahoo.com|2015-10-16T16:53:31+0000
Dear Sir / Madam, I came know from your customer service centre shift-incharge that the technology to ensure HDFC bank credit card will prompt for a PIN on usage at any POS terminal is not yet available and is in process. Is  it so? When other bank can provide such card, why this cannot be done at HDFC? How many more months do your customers have to wait for it?|2015-10-16T16:36:30+0000
I recently purchased a Hdfc forex card for travel . It gives me immense pain to say that the type of service your this department has is totally horrendous. We complained about two false transactions to the bank and requested for card statement .We used every Possible medium to get the statement phone banking , email compliant , visit to branch , talking to representative . Every department worked to its worst with IT dept sending us email attachment of statement with no content . Phone banking to our surprise reporting our complaint had been closed  . Physical branch refusing to help saying we used book my forex to purchase Hdfc forex card. For the bank as a grieving customer who is associated with Hdfc from last 9 years  all I can say is - it s shameful if a bank like yours can't stand up to its broad values .

HDFC Bank, Let's skip the greetings.  I made the ill-informed decision to get an HDFC Credit Card.  The level of unprofessionalism, complacency & lack of accountability that your employees have displayed has been impressive. And that was sarcastic.  1. I had applied for the card on 23rd June, the same day as my salaried account was opened and it took one month (30 days) for me to receive any kind of communication on the matter. That too after I wrote a mail to the concerned department.  2. I was asked for all information all over again over various emails & I eventually ended up sending 27 different e-mails with my information. With emails marked even to the managing director. Did something happen? No.  3. I had to send in more angry emails and then finally a sales representative was asked to contact me.  4. He told me of the process and assured me that everything should go smoothly. Did it? No.  5. You guys without giving me any prior information or instruction decided that the transfer method used to credit the salary into my account wasn't right. Even when I offered giving documents endorsing the transfer.  6. Regardless, the application did not go through that month & again I was assured that the next month it would work smoothly. Did it? No.  7. The next month the entire process was repeated & this time I was confident that no bank, however incompetent could actually care so little about service that it would in fact be reckless.  8. I was (Again, only on my frequent calling) told that this time too the card could not be processed because the last time the bank has tagged the application as declined & therefore I can't apply for the card for another 6 months.  Your bank & employees have no intent of service, no idea of ethic & no consideration for your customers. Need I remind you of your tagline, 'We understand your world.'  I am thoroughly disappointed, frustrated & surprised at the typically corporate behaviour, pathetic accountability & absence of responsibility.  HDFC bank, may I recommend 'We don't give a damn about your world.' as your new tagline.  I am surprised by you incompetence & audacity.|2015-10-16T12:40:47+0000

Cancelled flight ticket refund amount not credited to my bank account I have booked a flight ticket on 06/09/2015 from Allahabad to Delhi for Journey date 08/10/2015 through HDFC smartbuy (Goibibo Partner). The Goibibo cancelled the ticket on 30/09/2015 and the amount was refunded by airline as well as Goibibo. I have confirmation e-mail from Goibibo. But HDFC smart buy is not crediting the amount in my account. The HDFC smartbuy flight ticket booking reference no is - 1441779928264598 Many times I call & e-mailed to smartbuy, they have not even replied till now neither their call get connected to customer care if we keep on lone for 40+ minutes also. I would say, HDFC is a reliable organisation. But Smartbuy team spoiling HDFC's credibility. So requesting smart-buy team not to play with customer sentiment. Give correct information & refund the amount in time. If the the amount is not refunded in a day or 2, then I'll be forced to go to Consumer court.|2015-10-16T10:49:19+0000

One more reason to find HDFC bank having pathetic service. I have submitted form in bank for address change on 09th Oct. Its been a week and when I called today to call centre, got update that they have no idea about my form and they have not received it. This is height of stupidity from HDFC bank that first they make to fill the form to get drop at nearest ATM or Bank. And even after a week they are unable to track that request form.  I guess HDFFC is the only bank in 2015 which uses 20 years old updated method of address change by filling physical form with NO guarantee that whether your form will reach correct Bank deppt for processing or not.

Now when i did enquiry to the nearest branch they said may be it now 10,000/- for you thats why they have charged so, But still i get sms says when the available balance is less than 5,000/-, your minimum balance is 5000/-. why this kind of fine imposed with out any proper rule to do so. Will i get any resolution?|2015-10-16T06:32:28+0000

Hi, I just observed that this year my locker rent has been increased from 750 to 7000Rs. My personal banker mentioned that HDFC has decided to revise the rate. He, however, did not have any explanation on why the rate has been increased directly 10 times. There was no communication from Bank. What an unfair practice by HDFC bank.|2015-10-16T04:16:08+0000

The ATM located in the HDFC HUGHES ROAD BRANCH, MUMBAI, MAHARASHTRA, has for the FOURTH TIME IN ONE WEEK, NOT been able to dispense cash! The ATM No. as indicated on the "Withdrawal Declined Unable to Dispense" Slip is: SIACMB72. What kind of pathetic service is this? Your stupid Watchman asks me to go to Chowpatty ATM which is quite far away - this ATM is right next to my house.  Why are we being inconvenienced like this? Is this the kind of Customer Service HDFC offers? Am truly disappointed and am thinking of closing the Account.|2015-10-16T03:47:05+0000
I  am the HDFC flagship credit card holder with good track record. Logged a complaint ('HBL=031-123-173' ) regarding ClickNgo deal and HDFC bank.HDFC bank aggregator  misleading customers saying that they are Visa partners and they give 20% payback discount card. In fact, ClickNgo is not a Visa partner and customer will able to know when the money is debited using HDFC IVR system.  After long follow up ClickNgo says(Mr.Sanjiv)assured that they have refunded money back to HDFC but HDFC says No.  HDFC RM Mr.Rajeneesh is not giving any support to track the case and every time he says system is down and he never calls back and updates the status. Lousy and delayed reply from PriorityRedressal.CreditCards@hdfcbank.com. I would ask HDFC management why you are not Updating clickNgo claim that is money refunded, why HDFC is keeping relationship with misleading partners and how can they missell the product using HDFC IVR system.|2015-10-16T02:21:12+0000

HDFC is really very bad bank. Their customer care service is the worst . My Debit cards are details were used in transaction by someone else and after one month of lodging the complaint of forging the card details they are just not doing anything. I have provided every documents they asked for and it is now more than one month, they are not able to complete their investigation. I dropped several emails to bank managers but there is no answer  from their side. In their complaint site, I am only able to track the status which was last updated  after two days of the complaint.Since then there is no update from bank side and they is no particular concerned team/people with whom I can follow up. I will suggest other not to continue with HDFC and very soon I am going to change my bank once I reach India. I don't understand what is risk-control team of HDFC is doing for last one month. I do not feel it is secure bank anymore.|2015-10-15T10:57:36+0000

Mr. Puri. My name is Rahul sarkar holding the net banking id: 47329030. I am a loyal customer for  HDFC since 4 years approx. I never face any inconvenience regarding any transaction and i have a good monthly transaction, I was offered a pre approved loan of 7.5 lakhs displaying on my net banking. so I planned a car and took the loan for reference no. 35057125. but then I planned to change the are and gave another request for the same Ref:35701889, but this time it took a long tie for any information against the same. After number of calls to customer care a rude executive denied to help and gave a number of Mr. Prasanna Majumdar( sales manager) who never picks the call: 9312930497. After a long discussion with the loan department I came to know that the verification was conducted and the field guy mention wrong update that once the address was not found and second time the guard was not able to give proper info about the office. I do-not have any guard at my office neither the Field executive contacted me, and wrong information was updated to the dept. I am very much upset with this behaviour from HDFC and I thing It was a bad decision choosing hdfc as when i needed support not is whiling to help me .  I would be Sharing this bad experience of mine to all my colleagues and will ask my dept never to deal with HDFC bank. Sharing this to social networks to masses should know about the worst services of HDFC where always promises are made but never fulfilled. RAHUL SARKAR 9716648269|2015-10-15T10:48:45+0000

Just today I learnt that once HDFC bank customer place cheque book request on 18002703366 it cannot be cancelled. The problem here is the toll free number doesn't ask for any confirmation from customer before taking cheque book request. So person like me who calls to see the IVR menu, get disappointed because it straight away takes the call as a request for cheque book and the customer is charged Rs. 100 for the same. If customer wants to cancel this cheque book request, why HDFC bank not giving any option and making money out of customer errors ?|2015-10-14T10:42:26+0000

HDFC Bank is a big time fraud. Last year i opened a salary savings account with HDFC Bank and there Fraud executive opened a Demat account along with the salary account. I don't even know what should i do with that hell Demat account. HDFC Bank executive opened it without my consent.Just to meet his sales targets. It seems HDFC Bank is encouraging them to do that just to make their numbers.They kept on xharging me noney in my savings account that is the only reason i left HDFC Bank and opened my new salary account with another bank. I called their customer care as well.But the lady bluntly said that i have to pay INR 1500 only then they cqn close my account or else the account will remain active.I would never ever suggest any of my friend to go with hdfc bank at all. These guys are fraud and open the demat account with salary account. Beware and please read the document carefully before signing.|2015-10-14T09:48:42+0000
